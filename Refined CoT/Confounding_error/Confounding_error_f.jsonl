            "3. **Drawing the Circle**:\n   By drawing the circle that circumscribes the dodecagon, we can more easily analyze the angles and intersections created by these diagonals.\n",
            "4. **Calculating Angles Between Diagonals**:\n   From any vertex of the dodecagon, let's consider the diagonals that create angles at the center of the circumscribed circle:\n   - The angle from \\( P_1 \\) to \\( P_9 \\) along the circumference is \\( \\frac{8}{12} \\times 360^\\circ = 240^\\circ \\).\n   - Similarly, the angle from \\( P_2 \\) to \\( P_{11} \\) is \\( \\frac{9}{12} \\times 360^\\circ = 270^\\circ \\).\n   - The angle from \\( P_4 \\) to \\( P_{12} \\) is \\( \\frac{8}{12} \\times 360^\\circ = 240^\\circ \\).\n   \n   These angles help us understand the symmetry and possible intersections of the diagonals.\n",
            "5. **Symmetry Considerations**:\n   Because the dodecagon is regular, these diagonals do not merely intersect arbitrarily but have specific symmetrical properties:\n   - Diagonals \\( P_1 P_9 \\) and \\( P_4 P_{12} \\) both create the same angle of \\( 240^\\circ \\) and are thus symmetric along the vertical passing through the center.\n   - However, diagonal \\( P_2 P_{11} \\) does not necessarily pass through the center directly; it subtends an angle of \\( 270^\\circ \\), which means it does not pass through the center.\n",
            "6. **Conclusion on Intersection Point**:\n   Since \\( P_2 P_{11} \\) does not pass through the exact center of the polygon, diagonals \\( P_1 P_9 \\) and \\( P_4 P_{12} \\) do not necessarily intersect at the same point as \\( P_2 P_{11} \\).\n",
            "7. **Final Step**:\n   Hence, we find that diagonals \\( P_1 P_9 \\) and \\( P_4 P_{12} \\) do not necessarily intersect at the center of the circumscribing circle of the dodecagon, and \\( P_2 P_{11} \\) does not intersect with them at the center.\n",

This characteristic shapes the regularity and type of polygons that can form:\n   - For the polygon to be regular, all sides and angles must be equal.\n   \n5. **Regular Polygons Analysis:**\n   - **Equilateral Triangle:** The intersection with the plane can be at such an angle that only three faces are intersected, each contributing one side to form an equilateral triangle.\n   - **Square:** By intersecting four adjacent faces of the cube with the plane, a square can be formed.\n   - **Regular Pentagon (Pentagon with equal side lengths and angles):** By intersecting five faces of the cube, a regular pentagon is possible.\n   - **Regular Hexagon:** Intersecting one face where it touches six sides of the cube can form a regular hexagon.\n   \n6. **Conclusion:**\n   The only regular polygons that can be the result of the intersection of a cube with a plane are the equilateral triangle, the square, and the regular pentagon.

            "    - The non-overlapping ranges \\([1, 9]\\) from the digits adjacent to 0 and \\([10, 17]\\) from the digits adjacent to 9 provide us with at least one sum in each range. Hence, we have at least three distinct neighbor sums overall. However, we have overlooked the fact that the digit 9 can also form a sum with 0, which is 9, and the digit 0 can form a sum with 9, which is also 9. This means we might have overestimated the distinct sums.\n",
            "4. **Conclusion**:\n    - Upon re-evaluating, we see that the digit 9 and 0 can form the same sum, which is 9. Therefore, the actual distinct neighbor sums are two: one from the range \\([1, 9]\\) and one from the range \\([10, 17]\\).\n    - Thus, the minimal possible number of neighbor sums is:\n",

Let's denote the sum of the digits of the 99-digit number by $S$. \n   - If $S \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$ and we add $3$ (since $3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$), the sum remains divisible by $3$. \n   - If $S \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, adding $2$ (since $2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{3}$), the sum $S+2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$. \n   - If $S \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, adding $1$ (since $1 \\equiv -2 \\pmod{3}$), the sum $S+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$.\n",
            "5. Consequently, for each 99-digit number, there exactly exists one way to append a digit ($1$, $2$, or $3$) such that the resulting 100-digit number becomes divisible by $3$.\n",
            "6. Calculating the total number of possible 99-digit numbers:\n   - Each digit of a 99-digit number can be $1$, $2$, or $3$.\n   - Therefore, there are $3^{99}$ possible combinations of 99-digit numbers (since there are 3 choices for each of the 99 positions).\n",
            "7. However, for each of these $3^{99}$ possible 99-digit numbers, we must consider that appending a digit to make the sum divisible by 3 is not unique. Specifically, if the 99-digit number already has a sum divisible by 3, there are two possible digits we can append (1 or 2) to still keep the sum divisible by 3, not just one as previously stated.\n",
