Is it possible to obtain a table where all numbers are equal using these operations?", "ground_truth_solution": "## Problem\n\nWe have an $n \\times n$ table where $n-1$ cells contain the number $1$ and the remaining cells contain $0$. We are allowed to perform the following operation on the table: choose a cell, subtract $1$ from the number in that cell, and add $1$ to all numbers in the same row or column which intersect with the chosen cell. Can we transform the given table into a table where all numbers are equal?\n\n## Solution\n\n### Step 1: Initial Subtable Identification\nFirst, prove that there is a subtable $2 \\times 2$ within the initial table that contains one $1$ and three $0$s. This can be found easily because there is at least one row in the table filled with $0$s since there are $n$ rows and only $n-1$ ones.\n\n### Step 2: Detailed Explanation using Rows and Columns\nSince there are $n$ rows and only $n-1$ ones, there exists at least one row entirely filled with zeros. Within rows, we find a row next to the zero-filled row that contains at least one $1$ surrounded by zeros in adjacent columns.\n\n### Step 3: Consider a $2 \\times 2$ Subtable\nConsider picking any arbitrary $2 \\times 2$ subtable from the main table, with the numbers in its cells labeled as follows initially and after one operation:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{matrix}\na & b \\\\\nc & d \\\\\n\\end{matrix}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{matrix}\na_1 & b_1 \\\\\nc_1 & d_1 \\\\\n\\end{matrix}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Expression for $D$\nDefine the value $D$ as follows, which remains invariant given the operation rules:\n\n\\[\nD = (a + d) - (b + c)\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Possible Scenarios for Cell Modification\nConsider the scenarios where the chosen cell affects $D$:\n\n1. **Chosen cell outside and within row or column:**  \n   If a chosen cell lies outside the subtable but within the same row or column:\n   \\[\n   a_1 = a + 1, \\, b_1 = b + 1, \\, c_1 = c, \\, d_1 = d \\quad \\text{(if part of the same row)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   D_1 = (a+1 + d) - (b+1 + c) = D\n   \\]\n\n2. **Chosen cell outside and not affecting the row or column:**  \n   If a cell chosen is completely outside the subtable:\n   \\[\n   D_1 = D \\quad \\text{(clearly, no change)}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Chosen cell within the subtable:**  \n   If the cell is within the bounds of the $2 \\times 2$ subtable, let it be the top-left cell:\n   \\[\n   a_1 = a - 1, \\, b_1 = b + 1, \\, c_1 = c + 1, \\, d_1 = d\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   D_1 = (a-1 + d) - (b+1 + c+1) = D - 3\n   \\]\n\n### Step 6: Modules and Invariances\nWe demonstrate that the remainder of the division of $D$ by $3$ remains invariant:\n- Initially, if our subtable contains $D = \\pm 1$;\n- The target table with equal numbers would require $D = 0$ which conflicts.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy showing that the transformation to a destination where all cells have identical values is impossible due to a disagreement in invariant properties, the conclusion emerges.

Let's summarize the problem again:\n\n- **Initial Condition:** The game starts on a white $100 \\times 100$ grid.\n- **First Move:** Petya makes the first move by coloring one cell black.\n- **Subsequent Moves:** For each subsequent move, a player can color any white vertical or horizontal rectangle $1 \\times n$ where $n$ is a natural number. The rectangle must either match the number of cells just colored by the other player or exceed it by one.\n- **Winning Condition:** The player who cannot make a move loses the game.\n\n1. **Initial Observation:**\n    - Petya starts by coloring one cell (let's denote it by $P_1 = 1$).\n    - The game's symmetry plays a significant role because the grid has an even size, $100 \\times 100$. Vasya can leverage this symmetry.\n\n2. **Symmetry Argument:**\n    - Vasya can adopt a strategy where every time Petya colors a section of the grid, Vasya colors a section symmetrically opposite relative to the center of the grid.\n    - If Petya colors a cell at position $(i, j)$, Vasya can color the cell at position $(100-i, 100-j)$.\n    - Due to symmetry, after each of Vasya's moves, the position on the grid remains symmetric relative to its center.\n\n3. **Advantages of the Symmetric Strategy:**\n    - If Vasya always makes a move that maintains the symmetry relative to the center of the grid, he ensures that after each of his moves, a valid move always remains for him as long as there is a move for Petya.\n    - The crucial aspect of this strategy is that Vasya mirrors Petya’s move in a symmetric fashion, which is always possible as long as there’s space to move, ensuring a counter move till the end of the game.\n\n4. **Final Argument:**\n    - Given this symmetric strategy, Vasya can always respond to Petya's moves. When the grid becomes sufficiently filled, Petya will eventually face a situation where any move he makes will be immediately mirrored by Vasya.\n    - The symmetry ensures that Petya is forced into a position where he will be the first to be unable to make a legal move.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy adopting a symmetric strategy, Vasya ensures that Petya will be the first player to run out of moves, and thus Vasya will win the game with correct play from both sides.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Vasya wins.}}\n\\]", "Error CoT": ["1. **Initial Observation:**\n    - Petya starts by coloring one cell (let's denote it by $P_1 = 1$).\n    - The game's symmetry plays a significant role because the grid has an even size, $100 \\times 100$.
