We need to find the ratio $\\frac{|BC|}{|DC|}$.\n\n#### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Identifying Perpendicular Chord:**\n   By the given construction, observe that $PQ \\perp BC$ (refer to Figure 8 in the problem statement).\n\n2. **Intersection Point and Perpendicular Bases:**\n   Let:\n   - $T$ be the intersection of $MN$ and $PQ$,\n   - $L$ and $K$ be the bases of the perpendiculars dropped from $C$ and $B$ onto the line $MN$, respectively.\n   \n   Note that $L$ and $K$ are points on the circles constructed on $CN$ and $BM$ as diameters.\n\n3. **Using Intersecting Chords Theorem:**\n   According to the intersecting chords theorem in circles:\n   $$ |PT| \\cdot |TQ| = |NT| \\cdot |TL| $$\n   $$ |PT| \\cdot |TQ| = |MT| \\cdot |TK| $$\n\n4. **Equal Lengths on Perpendiculars:**\n   Since $|LT| = |CD|$ and $|TK| = |DB|$ (because $CLKB$ forms a rectangle, and hence $PQ \\perp CB$):\n   $$ |NT| \\cdot |CD| =  |MT| \\cdot |DB| $$\n   \n5. **Establishing the Ratio:**\n   Dividing both sides by $|NT| \\cdot |DB|$, we get:\n   $$ \\frac{|MT|}{|NT|} = \\frac{|CD|}{|DB|} $$\n\n6. **Conclusion Based on Perpendicular Bisectors:**\n   Since line $PQ$ divides $CB$ and $MN$ in the same ratio, $PQ$ must pass through vertex $A$, making $D$ the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $BC$ in triangle $ABC$.\n\n7. **Calculating Using Triangle Properties:**\n   Given angles:\n   $$ \\angle B = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\angle C = \\frac{\\pi}{6} $$\n\n   Since $D$ is the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $BC$, in $\\triangle ACD$ with $\\angle C = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$:\n   $$ \\frac{|BD|}{|DC|} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} $$\n\nTherefore, the desired ratio is:\n$$ \\boxed{\\frac{|BC|}{|DC|} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}} $$", "response": "\\boxed{2}"}

This is a key concept in geometry, often utilized in problems involving inscribed shapes (Thales' theorem).\n\n3. **Calculating the number of possible diameters:**\n   - If the polygon has 18 vertices, each vertex pairs with another to form a diameter.

Since they share the angle \\( \\angle AOD \\) and \\(\\angle ODK = \\angle AOK = 90^\\circ\\), the triangles are similar.\n\n   This gives us the proportion:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{KO}{OB} = \\frac{AO}{AB}\n   \\]\n   \n   where \\( KO = OL = OM = ON = r \\) (radius of the inscribed circle).\n\n   Let each side of the rhombus be \\( a \\).\n\n3. **Using Trigonometry:**\n   \n   Using the proportions and trigonometric relationships, we have:\n   \\[\n   OB = a \\sin 15^\\circ\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   AO = a \\cos 15^\\circ\n   \\]\n   \n   From the proportion, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{r}{a \\sin 15^\\circ} = \\frac{a \\cos 15^\\circ}{a}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   r = a \\sin 15^\\circ \\cos 15^\\circ\n   \\]\n   \n   Using the double angle identity, \\( \\sin 30^\\circ = 2 \\sin 15^\\circ \\cos 15^\\circ \\), we find:\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{a}{2} \\sin 30^\\circ = \\frac{a}{4}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Dimensions of the Square:**\n   \n   The diameter of the inscribed circle is the diagonal of the square. Therefore, if \\( b \\) is the side length of the square, we have:\n   \\[\n   2r = b\\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   b = \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{2}} = r\\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n   Using the value of \\( r \\):\n   \\[\n   b = \\frac{a}{4} \\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculating Areas:**\n\n   The area of the rhombus \\( S_1 \\) is:\n   \\[\n   S_1 = a^2 \\sin 30^\\circ = a^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n   \n   The area of the square \\( S_2 \\) is:\n   \\[\n   S_2 = b^2 = \\left(\\frac{a \\sqrt{2}}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{a^2 \\cdot 2}{16} = \\frac{a^2}{8}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Finding the Ratio:**\n\n   The ratio of the areas is then:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{S_1}{S_2} = \\frac{\\frac{a^2}{2}}{\\frac{a^2}{8}} = \\frac{\\frac{a^2}{2}}{\\frac{a^2}{8}} = 4\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]", "response": "\\boxed{2}"}

Since the park is a $100 \\times 100$ grid, this division will generate $\\dfrac{100 \\times 100}{2 \\times 2} = 2500$ quadrats.\n\n3. **Pigeonhole Principle**:\n   According to the Pigeonhole Principle, in any $2 \\times 2$ quadrat, removing more than one tree will result in there being a visible pair of stumps from at least one stump. Therefore, to ensure no two stumps are visible from one another, at most one tree can be cut down in each $2 \\times 2$ quadrat.\n\n4. **Optimal Tree Cutting**:\n   We select the trees to be cut in a systematic way.

If we take any half of segment \\( s \\), let's denote it as \\( s' \\), and apply a homothety (scaling transformation) with a factor of 3 centered at the midpoint of this half segment. The homothety transformation can be mathematically described as:\n   \\[\n   H(s') = 3s'\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( 3s' \\) implies the segment formed by enlarging \\( s' \\) by a factor of 3 while keeping the midpoint fixed.\n\n3. **Application of Homothety:**\n   This resulting segment \\( 3s' \\), by its construction, clearly contains the whole original segment \\( s \\). This insight demonstrates that by an appropriate homothety, every half segment \\( s' \\) (of any segment \\( s \\)) can effectively stretch to cover the entire original segment \\( s \\).\n\n4. **Covering the Whole Segment \\( AB \\):**\n   If we apply this process to all such shorter segments within \\( AB \\), scaling each remaining half segment by the factor of 3, the union of these scaled segments would fully cover the segment \\( AB \\). This is because each scaled half segment retains its coverage property over the original segments, which collectively cover \\( AB \\).\n\n5. **Summing the Lengths:**\n   Now, consider the total length of the scaled half segments. Since each half segment \\( s' \\) is scaled by a factor of 3, the total length of all scaled half segments will be three times the total length of the remaining half segments we initially started with:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total length of scaled segments} = 3 \\times (\\text{Total length of remaining half segments})\n   \\]\n   This total length must be at least the full length of \\( AB \\), as these segments cover \\( AB \\).\n\n6. **Minimum Length Coverage:**\n   Therefore, it can be inferred that:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (\\text{Total length of remaining half segments}) \\geq \\text{length of } AB\n   \\]\n   Dividing both sides by 3 gives:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total length of remaining half segments} \\geq \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ length of } AB\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThus, we have shown that even after discarding one half of each segment, the remaining halves together will cover at least \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the length of \\( AB \\). \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}\n\\]\n", "response": "\\boxed{3}"}

{"problem": "What time between 14:10 and 15:10 do the hands of the clock form a $90^{\\circ}$ angle?", "ground_truth_solution": "\n1. First, let's understand the problem: We need to determine the time between 14:10 and 15:10 when the angle between the minute and hour hands is exactly \\(90^\\circ\\).\n\n2. Consider the time at exactly 15:00.\n    - At 15:00, the hour hand is at 15 (or 3 on a 12-hour clock), making it \\(3 \\times 30^\\circ = 90^\\circ\\). Therefore, the angle between the minute hand (at 12) and the hour hand (at 3) is \\(90^\\circ\\). This matches our requirement instantly.\n\n3. Next, let's calculate the angle over time. We consider this calculation starting from 14:00:\n    - At 14:00, the hour hand is at 14 (or 2 on a 12-hour clock). Each hour mark on the clock represents \\(30^\\circ\\). Therefore, at 14:00, the hour hand is at:\n    \\[\n    2 \\times 30^\\circ = 60^\\circ\n    \\]\n    - Instead of it being at 2, it's actually slightly past 2 because it progresses each minute. Each minute, the hour hand shifts by: \n    \\[\n    \\frac{30^\\circ}{60} = 0.5^\\circ \\text{ per minute}\n    \\]\n    \n4.

Now, using these together, the equation becomes solving for when the difference in angle (one side) is \\(90^\\circ\\):\n    \\[\n    6n - (60 + 0.5n) = 90\n    \\]\n    Simplifying:\n    \\[\n    6n - 60 - 0.5n = 90\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    5.5n - 60 = 90\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    5.5n = 150\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    n = \\frac{150}{5.5} = \\frac{300}{11} = 27 \\frac{3}{11} \\text{ minutes}\n    \\]\n    \n9.

This prevents the formation of a winning sequence for Yi.\n    - After every move by Yi, if there exists a potential that the remaining numbers can form an arithmetic sequence after filling them, then Jia can move to disrupt this possibility.

The pirate who takes the coins last gets the diamond. Who will get the diamond if each pirate tries to obtain it? Provide the answer depending on the initial number of coins in the bags.", "ground_truth_solution": "\n\nLet's consider the case when the number of coins in the two bags differs by no more than 1.\n\n1. **Initial Setup and Strategy for the Second Pirate:**\n    - Assume that the second pirate always picks as many coins as the first pirate did but from the other bag.\n    - If the first pirate takes \\( k \\) coins from the first bag and transfers them to the second bag, then the second pirate will take \\( k \\) coins from the second bag and transfer them back to the first bag.\n\n2. **Verification:**\n    - After each move by the second pirate, the difference in the number of coins in the bags remains the same as it was at the beginning (no more than 1).\n    - The reason for this is that both pirates are effectively performing opposite moves on the coin counts.\n\n3. **Result after Several Moves:**\n    - Eventually, a situation will arise where one of the bags will have no coins left, and the other bag will have either exactly one coin or no coins, establishing the conditions of termination.\n\n4. **Implication of No Moves Left:**\n    - The first pirate won't be able to make a move if there are fewer coins in both bags than needed for the next legitimate move according to the game's rules.\n    - Thus, the game ends, and since the first pirate cannot move, the diamond will inevitably be awarded to the second pirate.\n\n5. **Considering a Different Initial Coin Difference:**\n    - If the initial number of coins in the bags differs by more than 1, the first pirate aims to make the differences reduced to the previously considered case (differ by 1 or less).\n    - This can be done by taking \\( m \\) coins where the difference is of the form \\( 3m \\) or \\( 3m \\pm 1 \\). Afterwards, it will match the already proven case where the second pirate ensures that the difference remains constrained (not more than 1).\n\n6. **Repetitive Strategy:**\n    - Following this strategy, any difference condition ultimately reduces the game to a scenario where one of the bags will inevitably end up empty, and the other bag will have a reduced number of coins close to zero, leading to the same conclusion as before.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- If the initial number of coins in the bags differs by no more than 1, the diamond will be awarded to the second pirate.\n- If the initial difference is more than 1, the first pirate reduces the game to the situation explained above and follows the same strategy until the game terminates in favor of the second pirate.\n\nThus, the diamond will always go to the second pirate given both pirates aim to win the diamond.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{The second pirate gets the diamond.}}\n\\]", "response": "\\boxed{2}"}

Consider the given infinite plane where the game occurs with two players: one controlling a single \"wolf\" token and the other controlling 50 \"sheep\" tokens.\n2. Both the wolf and the sheep can move in any direction, but they can only move a maximum of 1 meter per turn.\n3. To analyze the situation, let's consider 50 horizontal lines, each spaced 4 meters apart such that the uppermost line is 4 meters below the wolf's initial position.\n4. Place one sheep on each of these lines, with each sheep designated to move horizontally along its line.\n\n5.

Now we analyze whether the wolf can catch at least one sheep:\n   - When the wolf tries to approach a particular sheep's line, it will always lag behind the sheep’s position on that line.\n   - Consider the projection of the wolf's position onto the sheep’s line. The wolf’s projection on any particular line will trail behind the sheep’s movement because of its 1-meter per turn limit.\n\n7. The strategy ensures that the sheep will always maintain enough distance to avoid being caught by the wolf:\n   - The continuous movement of the sheep horizontally, combined with their constant adjustment based on the wolf's position, means the wolf will never manage to close the gap effectively.\n\n8.

The players take turns to split a pile with more than one stone into two smaller piles. Kolya plays first. The objective is to be the player who, after their move, leaves only piles of one stone.\n\n2. **Initial Move by Kolya:**\n\n    Kolya divides the initial pile of 100 stones into two piles of 63 and 37 stones. This is crucial because the number 100 decomposed into 63 and 37 is a strategic move. This specific decomposition is based on what is known in game theory as **Nim-sum** (XOR summation property).\n\n3. **Game Theory Insight - Grundy Numbers and Winning Strategy:**\n\n    - Every position in a combinatorial game can be assigned a Grundy number or Nim-sum.\n    - A position with a Grundy number of zero is a losing position if the opponent plays optimally.\n    - The initial position of a single pile of 100 stones is given by \\( G(100) = 100 \\) in terms of Grundy numbers.\n    - After splitting 100 into 63 and 37, we compute the Nim-sum (XOR):\n      \\[\n      63 \\oplus 37 = \\left(111111_2\\right) \\oplus \\left(100101_2\\right) = 011010_2 = 26\n      \\]\n\n4. **Ensuring Kolya's Win with Optimal Play:**\n\n    - After Kolya's first move to 63 and 37, the resulting Grundy number is 26, which is not zero. This indicates that Kolya has the winning strategy if she continues to play optimally. \n    - Vitya will then have to play in a state where the sum is non-zero, ensuring that Kolya can always make a move to revert to a non-zero sum, maintaining her advantageous position.\n\n5. **Iterative Strategy Application:**\n\n    In each subsequent turn, Kolya can continue to ensure that after she splits a pile, the Nim-sum (XOR) of the sizes of all piles is non-zero. This strategy can force Vitya into a series of moves that lead to a final configuration where Vitya leaves only piles with one stone, thus granting Kolya the win.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nKolya will win as long as she follows this optimal strategy from the beginning:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Yes}}\n\\]", "response": "\\boxed{1}"}

There are $n^2$ checkpoints numbered from 1 to $n^2$. \n\n2. **Defining the Structure of Connections:**\n   Each company operates $k$ cable cars where the starting and finishing points of the cars are in a strictly increasing sequence. This implies for Company $A$, if cable car $i$ starts at checkpoint $s_i$ and ends at checkpoint $f_i$, then $s_1 < s_2 < \\cdots < s_k$ and $f_1 < f_2 < \\cdots < f_k$.\n\n3. **Lower Bound Analysis for $k$:**\n   To understand the smallest value of $k$ required, let's check if it's possible that no overlapping links occur when $k \\leq n^2 - n$.\n   - For Company $A$, let it connect checkpoints $(i, i+1)$ for $i \\neq n, 2n, 3n, \\ldots, n(n-1)$. Here, $A$ connects neighboring checkpoints except those just before each multiple of $n$.\n   - For Company $B$, let it connect checkpoints $(i, i+n)$ where $1 \\leq i \\leq n^2 - n$. \n   \n   We need to check if any pair $(i, j)$ is linked by both companies.\n   - For Company $A$, the pairs $ (i, j)$ linked satisfy $j = i + t$ and $\\left\\lceil \\frac{i}{n} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil \\frac{j}{n} \\right\\rceil$ because it skips transitions at multiples of $n$.\n   - For Company $B$, the pairs linked satisfy $j = i + tn$ (mod $n$). Thus for any two linked points by $B$, $j$ must be $i (\\text{mod } n)$.\n   \n   Therefore, there is no overlap between $A$-linked and $B$-linked points. This shows it's possible to find no overlapping linked points when $k \\leq n^2 - n$.\n\n4. **Upper Bound Analysis and Establishing the Minimum:**\n   Now, consider $k = n^2 - n + 1$. We must show linked points exist in this case.\n   - We observe that if we increase $k$, we add more connections and chains. Define an $A$-chain as a sequence of connected checkpoints using Company $A$.\n     - Similarly, define $B$-chain for Company $B$.\n     - Any checkpoint would be part of a unique $A$ and a unique $B$ chain.\n   \n   Each non-finishing point of an $A$-car starts a new $A$-chain, leaving $n-1$ $A$-chains. Similarly, we form $n-1$ $B$-chains.\n   - We now count pairs $(A\\text{-chain}, B\\text{-chain})$ the checkpoint belongs to. Since there are $(n-1)^2$ pairs and $n^2$ checkpoints, including each checkpoint must belong to such a pairing.\n   - As $k = n^2 - n + 1$, meaning one more than $n^2 - n$, there must be at least 2 checkpoints that are common in linking by both companies due to the pigeonhole principle.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   Hence, the smallest $k$ needed to ensure that there exists at least one pair of checkpoints linked by both companies is \n   \\[\n   \\boxed{n^2 - n + 1}.\n   \\]", "response": "\\boxed{2}"}

{"problem": "Let $A$ be an $n$-digit positive integer with $n \\geq 2$, and $B$ be a $k$-digit positive integer with $k \\geq 1$. There are $n-1$ ways to insert $B$ entirely between the adjacent digits of $A$ to get an $n+k$-digit positive integer $C$. For example, if $A=1991$ and $B=35$, then there are three ways to insert $B$ to get $C$: $135991$, $193591$, or $199351$. If for every $A$ that can be divided by $B$, any way of inserting $B$ into $A$ results in $C$ also being divisible by $B$, then $B$ is called a coordinating number. \n\nAmong the numbers $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 66, 90$, how many are coordinating numbers?\n(A) 6 \n(B) 8 \n(C) 10 \n(D) 11", "ground_truth_solution": "\n1. **Identifying the Coordinating Numbers:**\n    - To determine if a number $B$ is a coordinating number, we need to check whether inserting $B$ at any position between the digits of $A$ (where $A$ is divisible by $B$) results in a new number $C$ that is also divisible by $B$.\n\n2. **Check $B = 1$:**\n    - Any number $A$ is divisible by 1. After inserting 1 into $A$, the resulting number $C$ will still be divisible by 1. \n    - Therefore, 1 is a coordinating number.\n\n3. **Check $B = 2$:**\n    - For $A$ to be divisible by 2, the last digit of $A$ must be even. Inserting 2 into $A$ at any position results in a number whose last digit is still even.\n    - Therefore, 2 is a coordinating number.\n\n4. **Check $B = 3$:**\n    - A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Inserting 3 into $A$ adds 3 to the sum of digits, which does not affect its divisibility by 3.\n    - Therefore, 3 is a coordinating number.\n\n5. **Check $B = 4$:**\n    - A number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4. Inserting 4 into an arbitrary position may not guarantee this condition is preserved.\n    - Therefore, 4 is not a coordinating number.\n\n6. **Check $B = 5$:**\n    - A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. Inserting 5 into the middle of $A$ will make the last digit either 0 or 5.\n    - Therefore, 5 is a coordinating number.\n\n7. **Check $B = 6$:**\n    - Since 6 is the product of 2 and 3, both of which are coordinating numbers, 6 will also be a coordinating number.\n    - Therefore, 6 is a coordinating number.\n\n8. **Check $B = 7$:**\n    - Divisibility rules for 7 are sophisticated and inserting 7 can disrupt these properties.\n    - Therefore, 7 is not a coordinating number.\n\n9. **Check $B = 8$:**\n    - A number is divisible by 8 if the number formed by the last three digits is divisible by 8. Inserting 8 does not necessarily preserve this property.\n    - Therefore, 8 is not a coordinating number.\n\n10. **Check $B = 9$:**\n    - Similar to 3, a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Inserting 9 increases the sum by 9, preserving divisibility by 9.\n    - Therefore, 9 is a coordinating number.\n\n11. **Check $B = 10$:**\n    - Like 5, a number is divisible by 10 if its last digit is 0. Inserting 10 keeps this property.\n    - Therefore, 10 is a coordinating number.\n\n12. **Check $B = 11$:**\n    - For a number divisible by 11, the difference between the sum of the digits at odd positions and even positions must be divisible by 11. This condition is preserved on inserting 11.\n    - Therefore, 11 is a coordinating number.\n\n13. **Check $B = 12$:**\n    - Since 12 = 3 × 4, and we already determined 4 is not a coordinating number, 12 is not a coordinating number.\n    - Therefore, 12 is not a coordinating number.\n\n14. **Check $B = 15$:**\n    - Since 15 = 3 × 5, both of which are coordinating numbers, 15 will also be a coordinating number.\n    - Therefore, 15 is a coordinating number.\n\n15. **Check $B = 66$:**\n    - Since 66 = 2 × 3 × 11, and all these factors are coordinating numbers, 66 must be a coordinating number.\n    - Therefore, 66 is a coordinating number.\n\n16. **Check $B = 90:**\n    - Since 90 = 2 × 3 × 5, all these factors are coordinating numbers, so 90 will also be a coordinating number.\n    - Therefore, 90 is a coordinating number.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The coordinating numbers among $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 66, 90$ are: $1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 15, 66, 90$.\n- Hence, the total number of coordinating numbers is 11.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{11}\n\\]", "response": "\\boxed{11}"}

This implies that the outer circumference is twice the inner circumference:\n   \\[\n   C_{outer} = 2 \\times C_{inner}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Circumference and Diameter Relationship:**\n\n   The circumference of a circle is given by:\n   \\[\n   C = \\pi \\times D\n   \\]\n   Where \\( C \\) is the circumference and \\( D \\) is the diameter.\n\n4. **Establishing Diameters Ratio:**\n\n   Since the circumference of the outer circle is twice the circumference of the inner circle, the diameters must also satisfy:\n   \\[\n   D_{outer} = 2 \\times D_{inner}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculating the Diameters:**\n\n   The given distance between the wheels (1.5 m) represents the difference in radii between the outer and inner circles:\n   \\[\n   R_{outer} - R_{inner} = 1.5 \\, \\text{m}\n   \\]\n   Also we know from the speed relationship:\n   \\[\n   D_{outer} = 2 \\times D_{inner}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Expressing the Diameters in Terms of the Radii:**\n\n   Using the relationship \\( D = 2 \\times R \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times R_{outer} = 2 \\times (R_{inner} + 1.5 \\text{ m})\n   \\]\n   Since,\n   \\[\n   D_{inner} = 2 \\times R_{inner}\n   \\]\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   D_{outer} = 2 \\times D_{inner}\n   \\]\n   Hence:\n   \\[\n   R_{outer} = 2 \\times R_{inner}\n   \\]\n   Combining both, we have:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times (R_{inner} + 1.5 \\text{ m}) = 2 \\times 2 \\times R_{inner}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   R_{inner} + 1.5 \\text{ m} = 2 \\times R_{inner}\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times R_{inner} = 3 \\text{ m} \\Rightarrow R_{inner} = 1.5 \\text{ m}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Calculating Circular Parameters:**\n\n   \\[\n   R_{outer} = R_{inner} + 1.5 \\text{ m} = 1.5 \\text{ m} + 1.5 \\text{ m} = 3 \\text{ m}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   D_{outer} = 2 \\times R_{outer} = 2 \\times 3 \\text{ m} = 6 \\text{ m}\n   \\]\n\n8. **Finding the Circumference of the Outer Circle:**\n\n   Using \\( C_{outer} = \\pi \\times D_{outer} \\):\n   \\[\n   C_{outer} = \\pi \\times 6 \\text{ m}\n   \\]\n\n9. **Approximating:**\n\n   Using \\(\\pi \\approx 3.1416\\):\n   \\[\n   C_{outer} \\approx 3.1416 \\times 6 = 18.8496 \\text{ m}\n   \\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{18.85 \\text{ m}}\n\\]", "response": "\\boxed{3}"}

According to the statements, everyone says: \"My number is greater than the numbers of my two neighbors.\"\n   - If $A$ (the person with the smallest number) says this, it must be a lie because it’s impossible for the smallest number to be greater than its neighbors.

Find the angle at the base of the trapezoid.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   Given an isosceles trapezoid inscribed around a circle, where the ratio of the lengths of its parallel sides, the longer base \\( a \\) and the shorter base \\( b \\), is \\( k \\) such that:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{a}{b} = k\n   \\]\n\n2. **Properties of Isosceles Trapezoid:**\n   - Because the trapezoid is isosceles and inscribed around a circle, the sum of the opposite sides is equal (this is a property of a cyclic quadrilateral):\n   \\[\n   a + b = c + d\n   \\]\n   where \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) are the non-parallel sides, which are equal in an isosceles trapezoid. Thus, \\( c = d \\).\n\n3. **Using the Circle Properties:**\n   - Since the circle is inscribed in the trapezoid, the sum of the lengths of the bases is equal to the sum of the lengths of the legs:\n   \\[\n   a + b = 2c\n   \\]\n\n4. **Set Up Ratio Using \\( k \\):**\n   \\[\n   a = kb\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( a = kb \\) into the equation \\( a + b = 2c \\):\n   \\[\n   kb + b = 2c\n   \\]\n   Factor out \\( b \\):\n   \\[\n   b(k + 1) = 2c\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( c \\):**\n   \\[\n   c = \\frac{b(k + 1)}{2}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Finding the Angle Using Properties:**\n   Recall that the angles in a trapezoid inscribed around a circle are related due to the cyclic nature of the shape. Each pair of opposite angles sum to \\( \\pi \\) radians (180 degrees).\n\n7. **Trapezoid Symmetry and Bisector:**\n   In an isosceles trapezoid, the diagonals are equal, and they create two congruent right triangles when they intersect. The angle at the base \\( \\theta \\) can be derived using the fact that the angles between the legs and the bases must match those summing with the corresponding angles.\n\n8. **Using the Tangent Property:**\n   - We will use the derived lengths and inscribed circle properties to find the tangent of the angle. For an isosceles trapezoid inscribed around a circle with bases \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) where \\( \\theta \\) is the angle at the base:\n\n   \\[\n   \\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{adjacent}}\n   \\]\n\n   - Using trigonometric identities and inscribed circle properties:\n     \\[\n     \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{k}\n     \\]\n\n9. **Final Conclusion:**\n   The angle at the base of the isosceles trapezoid inscribed around a circle with the ratio \\( k \\) of its bases is derived by understanding the relationship between the isosceles properties and the trapezoid's symmetry.\n\nThus, the base angle is solved completely using the given properties and derived relationships.\n\nThe angle at the base is:\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{k}}\\]\n\nNote: Instructions and specific values for \\( k \\) must be given or inferred to find a specific numerical angle.

{"problem": "Two players are playing the following game: starting from the bottom-left corner of an $8 \\times 8$ chessboard, they take turns moving a piece. The piece can move to the square to its right, the square above it, or the square diagonally up and to the right (if such squares exist). The winner is the player who moves the piece to the top-right corner.\n\nWith optimal play, does the starting player or their opponent win? How should the winning player play?", "ground_truth_solution": "1. **Identify Winning and Losing Positions:**\n   - We start by analyzing the end goal, which is the top-right corner of the chessboard.\n   - Let us denote the top-right corner square as the target square.\n   - The positions that are one move away from the target square are winning positions because the current player can immediately move the piece into the target square and win the game. These squares are the ones immediately to the left, directly below, and diagonally below-left of the target square. We label these squares as \"1.\"\n\n2. **Marking Losing Positions:**\n   - From these winning positions, we can find the losing positions for the opponent.\n   - A losing position is any position where all possible moves would lead to a winning position for the opponent.\n   - For example, if the piece is on a square from where any move puts it on a \"1\"-marked square (winning position), then this square is a losing position. Mark these squares as \"2.\"\n\n3. **Iterate for Further Positions:**\n   - Repeat the process for identifying winning and losing positions:\n     - Squares from which any move leads to a \"2\" (losing position) are winning positions, and we mark them with \"3.\"\n     - Squares from which any move leads to a \"3\" (winning position) are losing positions, and we mark them with \"4.\"\n   - Continue this process until all squares on the board are marked appropriately as either winning or losing positions. Refer to the diagram to encode this.\n\n4. **Determine the Starting Position:**\n   - The lower-left corner of the board is the starting position of the piece.\n   - Check the marking of this starting position in the completed chessboard diagram. If it is a marked winning square, the player who starts the game can always win with the correct strategy.\n\n5. **Strategy for the First Player:**\n   - Ensure the opponent always finds themselves on a losing position.\n   - One effective strategy for the first player is to move diagonally up and to the right on their first move.\n   - Afterward, the first player mimics the opponent's move (if the opponent moves up, the first player does the same; if the opponent moves to the right, the first player does the same). This ensures that the opponent always ends up on a losing position.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the starting position is marked as a winning square based on our backward induction process, the first player can always enforce a strategy that forces the opponent to be on losing positions continuously.\n   - Thus, following optimal play, the first player will always win.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{The starter will always win if they play optimally.}}\n\\]", "response": "\\boxed{2}"}

{"problem": "According to an improbable legend, Cauchy and Bunyakovsky enjoyed playing darts in the evenings.

Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Factorial Breakdown**: Recognize that each digit at a specific position contributes a block of permutations.\n    - There are $6! = 720$ permutations starting with each initial digit.\n\n2. **Determine leading digit**:\n    - Since we need the 2520th permutation, we note that $2520 \\div 720 = 3.5$.

We need to demonstrate that it can return to its starting point only after a whole number of hours.\n\n2. **Time Calculation**:  \n   Since the snail turns every 15 minutes, we convert this into hours:\n   \\[\n   15 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{15}{60} \\text{ hour} = \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ hour}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Path Segments**:  \n   Let the snail's speed be \\(v\\) (constant).

When there is only one such line:\n\n1. Consider a given line $e$ in the plane. The points in the plane that are at a distance $d$ from $e$ will lie on two lines, $g_1$ and $g_2$, which are parallel to $e$ and at distance $d$ on either side of $e$. Thus, $g_1$ and $g_2$ are also parallel to each other.\n   \n2. In our problem, suppose that there exists a line $e$ equidistant from points $A, B, C, D$. This implies that $A, B, C, D$ must lie on these two parallel lines $g_1$ and $g_2$. Their relative positions can be three types based on how they align:\n   \n   - **Case \\( \\alpha \\)**: Two of the points on $g_1$ and the other two on $g_2$. For example, if $A, B$ lie on $g_1$ and $C, D$ lie on $g_2$, then $A, B \\parallel C, D$. Hence, they form the vertices of a trapezoid.\n     \n   - **Case \\( \\beta \\)**: Three points on one of the lines, say $g_1$, and the fourth point on the other line $g_2$. For example, if $A, B, D$ lie on $g_1$ and $C$ on $g_2$, then $A, B, D$ form a triangle with $C$ somewhere distinct from $A$ and $B$.\n     \n   - **Case \\( \\gamma \\)**: All four points lie on the same line, $g_1$.\n   \n   In Case \\( \\alpha \\) and Case \\( \\beta \\), the specific line $e$ under consideration would be the line of the midsegment (median) of the trapezoid or the line parallel to $AB$ passing through the centroid of the triangle. This midline would be at a distance equal to half the height of the trapezoid or triangle.\n\n   In Case \\( \\gamma \\), there are infinitely many parallel lines that meet the condition since all points are collinear, and $e$ can be any line parallel to $g_1$.\n\n#### 2.

Furthermore, $f$ cannot be parallel to $e$ since $A, B$ and $C, D$ would also be in a unique distance alignment. This implies that points form a parallelogram because lines $AD$ and $BC$ should also be parallel.\n   \n   - If assumed in Case \\( \\beta \\) relative to $e$, positioning relative to $f$ would need reanalysis but eventually also leads to contradiction without forming the midpoint uniqueness of distances. Hence, these setups fall into the Case \\( \\alpha \\) nature for the other direction as well.\n   \n   - Finally, if in Case \\( \\gamma \\) relative to $e$, then $f$ being parallel to $e$ is trivial and expected. Thus initial assumptions hold with infinitely many possibilities with points aligning.\n\nHence, the most complete and viable arrangement in both cases consistently suggests the points must form vertices of a parallelogram when two such lines $e$ and $f$ exist.\n\n**Conclusion:** The points $A, $B, $C, $D$ form the vertices of a parallelogram if there exist two lines that are equidistant from all four points.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{The points form the vertices of a parallelogram.}}\n\\]", "response": "\\boxed{1}"}

In what ratio does $P$ divide the segment $AS$?", "ground_truth_solution": "\n1. **Define Key Points:**\n   - Let $H$ denote the point on $AC$, which is one-third the distance from $A$ (hence, $H$ is the trisection point closer to $A$).\n   - Let $F_C$ denote the midpoint of side $AB$.\n   - Let $S$ denote the centroid of triangle $ABC$.\n\n2. **Understanding $\\overline{AS}$ and $\\overline{HS}$:**\n   - We know that in a triangle, the centroid divides each median in the ratio 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Thus, $\\overline{AS}$ is divided such that $\\frac{AS}{SF_C} = 2$.\n\n3. **Applying the Properties of Parallel Lines and Segments:**\n   - Using the triangle proportionality theorem (also known as the Basic Proportionality Theorem or Thales' theorem), we see that $\\overline{HS} \\parallel \\overline{AB}$.

Let $M$ be such a set of points. Consider the convex hull $V$ of this set. \n2. The polygon $V$ cannot have an obtuse angle. \n3. Indeed, if $A, B$, and $C$ are consecutive vertices of the polygon $V$, and the angle $\\angle ABC$ is obtuse, then the orthocenter $H$ of the triangle $ABC$ lies outside the angle $\\angle ABC$, and thus, outside $V$.\n4. Therefore, $V$ is either an acute-angled triangle, a right-angled triangle, or a square.\n\nNext, we examine each of these polygons:\n\n**Case 1: Acute-Angled Triangle**\n\n1. Assume $V$ is an acute-angled triangle $ABC$. Let $H$ denote its orthocenter, which belongs to $M$. \n2. Consider another point $K$ in $M$ apart from points $A, B, C$, and $H$.\n3. Point $K$ must lie within one of the triangles $ABH$, $BCH$, or $CAH$ (since it lies inside $V$). For definiteness, assume it lies in triangle $BCH$.\n4. We know $\\angle BAC + \\angle BHC = 180^{\\circ}$.\n5. Since $K$ lies in triangle $BCH$, the angle $\\angle BHC$ is less than the angle $\\angle BKC$ (prove this!). \n6. The orthocenter $L$ of triangle $BCK$ must lie inside $V$, giving us:\n7. $\\angle BLC \\geq \\angle A$, while $\\angle BKC + \\angle BLC > 180^{\\circ}$, which contradicts the properties of the orthocenter.\n8. Therefore, no such point $K$ exists, and the set $M$ can only consist of the vertices of the triangle $ABC$ and its orthocenter $H$.\n\n**Case 2: Right-Angled Triangle**\n\n1. The orthocenter of a right-angled triangle coincides with the vertex of the right angle.\n2. Applying the same reasoning as in Case 1, one can show that besides the vertices $A, B, C$ of $V$, no other point can belong to the set $M$.\n\n**Case 3: Square**\n\n1. Consider $V$ as a square. \n2. The orthocenter of any triangle formed by three vertices of the square coincides with one of these vertices.\n3.

What is the highest qualification number that the winner can have?", "ground_truth_solution": "\n1. **Understanding the Problem**:\n    - Each participant in a wrestling tournament is assigned a qualification number.\n    - If two wrestlers have qualification numbers differing by more than 2, the wrestler with the lower number always wins.\n    - This tournament has 256 participants and follows the Olympic system, where the loser of each match is eliminated.\n    - We aim to determine the highest possible qualification number for the tournament winner.\n\n2. **Analyzing Possible Defeats**:\n    - A wrestler with qualification number \\( k \\) can only lose to wrestlers with number \\( k+1 \\) or \\( k+2 \\).\n    - After each tournament round, the smallest remaining qualification number can increase by at most 2.\n    - For a tournament with 256 participants, there will be \\( \\log_2 256 = 8 \\) rounds.\n\n3. **Calculating the Bound**:\n    - The smallest possible qualifier number increases by a maximum of 2 per round.\n      Therefore, after 8 rounds, the highest possible smallest number is:\n    \\[\n    1 + 2 \\times 8 = 1 + 16 = 17\n    \\]\n    - Consequently, the qualification number for the tournament winner should not exceed 17.\n\n4. **Checking if Number 17 Can Win**:\n    - Suppose a wrestler with number 17 could win:\n      - For him to win, wrestlers with numbers 1 and 2 must be eliminated in the first round.\n      - Wrestler 1 must lose to wrestler 3, and wrestler 2 must lose to wrestler 4.\n      - In this pattern, the following rounds will ensure that participants like numbers 3, 4, 5, etc. remain while eliminating those less in number.\n      - This leads to an eventual contradiction where only wrestlers 15 and 16 remain, meaning that wrestler 17 cannot be the winner.\n    \\[\n    \\text{Contradiction that wrestler 17 can win.}\n    \\]\n\n5. **Proving Wrestler 16 Can Win**:\n    - We now show that a wrestler with number 16 can indeed win:\n      - Label wrestlers with numbers higher than 16 as \"weak\" wrestlers.\n      - In each round \\( k \\leq 7 \\): \n        - Wrestler \\( 2k-1 \\) loses to wrestler \\( 2k+1 \\).\n        - Wrestler \\( 2k \\) loses to wrestler \\( 2k+2 \\).\n        - Remaining wrestlers \\( 2k+3 \\) to 16 win over weak wrestlers.\n      - Afther 7 rounds, the remaining wrestlers will be those with numbers 15 and 16.\n        - In the final round, wrestler 16 will defeat wrestler 15.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n    - Thus, the highest possible qualification number for the tournament winner is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{16}\n\\]", "response": "\\boxed{128}"}

Please prove your conclusion.", "ground_truth_solution": "\nTo solve this problem, we must determine the number of matches the B team from City A has participated in, given the constraints outlined. Here's a detailed step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Total Number of Teams:**\n   As there are 16 cities participating and each city sends two teams (Team A and Team B), the total number of teams is:\n   \\[\n   16 \\times 2 = 32 \\text{ teams}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Maximal Matches Per Team:**\n   Since teams from the same city do not play against each other, each team can compete with every other team once, except with the team from their own city. Therefore, the maximum number of matches each team can play is:\n   \\[\n   32 - 2 = 30 \\text{ matches}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Unique Match Counts:**\n   Excluding A city's Team A, the remaining 31 teams have played different numbers of matches. Since the range of possible match counts is from 0 to 30 and they are all distinct, for simplicity, we can assign match counts as:\n   \\[\n   0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 30\n   \\]\n\n4. **Pairings of Teams from Same City:**\n   Let \\( a_k \\) represent the team that has played \\( k \\) matches.

Given \\( n > 4 \\), the smallest prime \\( p \\) must be greater than 2 (since \\( 2^2 = 4 \\)).\n   - Consider \\( p > 2 \\), the minimal \\( p \\) would be 3, making \\( n = 9 \\) the smallest possible value under this scenario.\n   - For \\( n = 9 \\), note that \\((n-1)! = 8!\\) which includes both \\( p \\) and \\( 2p \\) (because \\( 2p < 9 \\)).\n   - Since \\( 8! \\) contains both \\( p \\) and \\( 2p \\) as factors, \\( 8! \\) includes the product \\( 2p^2 = 2n \\), contradicting the non-divisibility by \\( n \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Both scenarios lead to contradictions implying that if \\( n > 4 \\) and \\((n-1)!\\) is not divisible by \\( n \\), then \\( n \\) must be a prime number. \n\nTherefore, we conclude that:\n\\[ \\boxed{n \\text{ is a prime number}} \\]", "response": "\\boxed{n \\text{ is a prime number}}"}

{"problem": "What irregular polygons can be formed when intersecting a cube with a plane?", "ground_truth_solution": "\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   We need to determine which regular polygons may result from the intersection of a cube with a plane.\n\n2. **Examining the Intersection:**\n   Each side of the resulting polygon lies on one of the faces of the cube. This is because the plane intersects the cube, creating edges that correspond to lines on the cube’s faces.\n\n3. **Counting the Sides:**\n   Since there are 6 faces on a cube and each side of the polygon must lie on one of these cube faces, the maximum number of sides a resulting polygon can have is 6.\n\n4. **Parallelism Consideration:**\n   The sides of the polygon that belong to opposite faces of the cube will be parallel, as these faces themselves are parallel. This characteristic shapes the regularity and type of polygons that can form:\n   - For the polygon to be regular, all sides and angles must be equal.\n   \n5. **Regular Polygons Analysis:**\n   - **Equilateral Triangle:** The intersection with the plane can be at such an angle that only three faces are intersected, each contributing one side to form an equilateral triangle.\n   - **Square:** By intersecting four adjacent faces of the cube with the plane, a square can be formed.\n   - **Regular Pentagon (Pentagon with equal side lengths and angles):** By intersecting five faces of the cube, a regular pentagon is possible.\n   - **Regular Hexagon:** Intersecting one face where it touches six sides of the cube can form a regular hexagon.\n   \n6. **Conclusion:**\n   The only regular polygons that can be the result of the intersection of a cube with a plane are the equilateral triangle, the square, and the regular pentagon.

Which initial positions allow a series of moves to change all the signs to plus?", "ground_truth_solution": "\n1. **Identify Initial Setup and Moves**:\n   - We start with a 5x5 board, where one of the squares has a minus sign, and all other squares have plus signs.\n   - A move consists of selecting a 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, or 5x5 square and changing all the signs within that square.\n\n2. **Analyze the Impact of Moves**:\n   - Each move inverts the signs within the selected sub-square. This means that every square within the selected sub-square changes its sign (plus to minus or minus to plus).\n\n3. **Center Square Strategy**:\n   - Consider selecting the entire 5x5 square for our move. This will change all squares on the board, flipping the sign of the central square too.\n   - Next, consider the impact on overlapping 3x3 squares that include the central square. Two overlapping 3x3 squares will change signs of squares, ensuring that most squares except potentially the center square, change signs an even number of times.\n\n4. **Observation of Changes in Even Parity**:\n   - The key aspect is the parity (even or odd number of changes) of the squares:\n   - If the central square was the initial square with the minus sign, it will undergo a specific sequence of changes: first, it will be flipped by the 5x5 selection, and then potentially flipped back by overlapping 3x3 or 2x2 selections. \n   - Squares other than the central square, which participate in multiple overlapping sub-squares, will experience an even number of flips due to symmetry and overlap patterns.\n\n5. **Conclusion on Feasibility for Non-Central Squares**:\n   - If the initially selected minus-signed square is not the central square, applying the moves will affect multiple non-central squares an odd number of times, which will spread the minus sign around, making it impossible to convert all signs to plus using the moves described.\n   - Thus, to end up with all plus signs, the initial minus-signed square must be the central one. This is because only this specific configuration ensures that all other squares are changed an even number of times through appropriately chosen moves.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only initial position that allows a series of moves to change all the signs to plus is when the central square is the one with the initial minus sign. \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{central square}}\n\\]", "response": "\\boxed{1}"}

Additionally, \\( p \\) should be a divisor of 6480, and \\( p + 3 \\) should be a divisor of 11200.\n\n7. Factoring the numbers:\n   \\[\n   6480 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^4 \\cdot 5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   11200 = 2^6 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7\n   \\]\n\n8. From the factorization, we determine possible values for \\( p \\) and \\( p + 3 \\):\n   - Identify the factors of 6480, such as \\( p = 2^a \\cdot 3^b \\cdot 5^c \\) where \\( 0 \\leq a \\leq 4 \\), \\( 0 \\leq b \\leq 4 \\), \\( c = 0 \\) or \\( 1 \\).\n\n9. Since \\( p \\geq 5 \\), we can start checking possible values:\n   - \\( p = 5 \\rightarrow p + 3 = 8 \\)\n   - \\( p = 10 \\rightarrow p + 3 = 13 \\) (13 is a prime and doesn't factorize 11200)\n   - \\( p = 15 \\rightarrow p + 3 = 18 \\) (18 doesn't factorize 11200)\n   - \\( p = 60 \\rightarrow p + 3 = 63 \\) (63 = 2^0 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7)\n   - Continue until all divisors in bounds are checked...\n\n10.

{"problem": "The heights of a parallelogram are more than 1. Is it necessarily possible to place a unit square inside it?", "ground_truth_solution": "To determine if it is always possible to place a unit square inside a parallelogram given that the heights of the parallelogram are greater than 1, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Diagonal Projections Constraint**: \n   Consider the diagonals of the unit square. The projections of these diagonals onto any line perpendicular to the edges of a strip with height greater than 1 cannot exceed the strip’s width. This means each diagonal must form a sufficiently small angle with the line perpendicular to the strip.\n\n2. **Critical Angle Analysis**:\n   Choose an angle $\\theta$ such that the critical angle condition is met. This can be stated mathematically as:\n   \\[\n   \\sin(\\theta) \\leq \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n   \\]\n   Here, $\\theta$ is the angle between the boundary of the strip and one side of the square. When this condition holds, the acute angle $\\alpha$ between one side of the square and the boundary of the strip will also satisfy:\n   \\[\n   \\alpha \\leq 45^\\circ\n   \\]\n   Conversely, if the boundary forms an obtuse angle $\\beta$ with the side, then:\n   \\[\n   \\alpha \\geq 45^\\circ\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Rhombus Example**:\n   Consider a rhombus with a height greater than 1. If we attempt to place a unit square inside it, any side of the rhombus forming an angle $\\alpha$ with one side of the square will satisfy the above constraints. Further, if one side of the square aligns with a side of the rhombus in such a way, the acute angle of the rhombus must be:\n   \\[\n   \\alpha \\leq 45^\\circ\n   \\]\n   Conversely, if the side of the square aligns differently, the acute angle must satisfy:\n   \\[\n   \\alpha \\geq 45^\\circ\n   \\]\n   Therefore, if one acute angle is necessarily less or greater as derived from constraints, it suggests the rhombus and therefore the parallelogram must have the height adequately covering to contain the square.\n\n4. **Final Conclusion**:\n   By removing any spatial constraints and strictly observing the height constraint of being greater than 1, we have assured that it is always feasible to place a unit square within any parallelogram. This follows since the required minimum constraint always leads to possible accommodation under geometric transformations and height-length permutations pairing respectively.\n\nTherefore, it is indeed possible to always place a unit square inside a parallelogram when its heights are greater than 1.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Hem.}}\n\\]", "response": "\\boxed{2}"}

Since the islands are in the river, part of their perimeters contributes to the projection on one bank.\n\n3. **Calculations and analysis:**\n   - Let's denote the total projected length on the bank as \\(P\\).\n   - The total perimeter \\(8 \\text{ meters}\\) represents the boundary measurements around all the islands.\n   - For simplicity, let's assume the widths of the islands contribute towards the projections.\n\n   - Consider each island with a projection \\(w_i\\) on the river bank (each island’s width is \\(w_i\\)).\n\n   - Therefore, the maximum sum of all projections (if all the islands were aligned side by side without overlapping, which is an extreme case) is such that:\n\n     \\[\n     P \\leq \\frac{8}{2} = 4 \\text{ meters}\n     \\]\n\n     - This is because only the lengths of the island facing directly across the river contribute to half of the perimeter measurement.\n\n4. **Determining the crossing distance:**\n   - Between the projections of the islands, there will be gaps as they are scattered along the riverbank. The gaps between these projections represent passages where the river is clear.\n   - Since the river width is 1 meter, any direct perpendicular crossing is always 1 meter.\n\n   - If Znayka were to cross the river, he could aim to navigate through these clear passages.\n   - The key observation is the total clear space would force Znayka to find the nearest gap. Since \\(P \\leq 4 \\text{ meters} \\), meaning at least half of the span is clear.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the given width and realizable projections, the total length \\(P < 4 \\text{ meters}\\) allows for gaps of at least 0.5 meters interspersed among the islands.\n   - Thus, it is always possible to find a gap of less than 2 meters to cross, confirming Znayka's assertion.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Znayka is correct.}}\n\\]", "response": "\\boxed{1}"}

However, since a bagel has a more complex topology because of its hole, let's consider cutting it into planar-like sections.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Bagel (Torus) Cuts**:\n\n   We can use combinatorics similarly to plane cuts by projecting onto simpler sections while considering the non-planar nature increases complexity compared to a plane but maintains a similar process for initial reasoning.\n\n4. **Calculation for the Number of Pieces**:\n\n   Each additional cut generally could double the pieces to a certain extent given optimal positioning. However, for the bagel, we reference a simpler, combinatorial approach. Each new cut potentially intersects with all previous cuts (akin to a plane).\n\n   The number of pieces formula is adapted by considering each cut intersecting all previous without repetition; hence for an optimal cut scenario:\n\n   \\[\n   P(n) \\approx  n + 1\n   \\]\n\n    For `10` cuts:\n\n   \\[\n   P(10) = 10 + 1 = 11\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n\n   Under optimal non-crossing, simplifying the toroidal complexities to planar cuts:\n\n   The number of pieces resulting from 10 cuts on a bagel is \\( \\boxed{11} \\).", "response": "\\boxed{21}"}

Note that for sufficiently large $x$, the term $x^3$ will dominate over $kx$, hence $(x^3 + kx)$ will be positive when $x$ is large.\n\n2. **Determining $x_0$ such that $x^3 + kx > 0$ for $x > x_0$:**\n   - If $k \\geq 0$, then:\n     \\[\n     x^3 + kx \\geq x^3 > 0 \\quad \\text{for} \\quad x > 0.\n     \\]\n   Thus, we can take $x_0 = 0$.\n   \n   - If $k < 0$, there exists some point where $x^3 + kx > 0$ for all $x$ greater than that point. Specifically:\n     \\[\n     x^3 + kx = x \\left( x^2 + k \\right).\n     \\]\n     This is positive when $x > \\sqrt{-k}$. Thus we can choose:\n     \\[\n     x_0 = \\sqrt{-k}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Bounding and Analyzing the Roots of $y(x)$ Greater Than $x_0$:**\n   - Suppose $a < b$ are two consecutive zeros of $y(x)$ greater than $x_0$, meaning $y(a) = y(b) = 0$.\n   - On the interval $(a, b)$, $y(x)$ must retain a consistent sign, say $y(x) > 0$ for $a < x < b$.\n\n     But in this scenario, $y'' = (x^3 + kx)y$ would be positive over $(a, b)$ because $(x^3 + kx) > 0$. This implies $y'' > 0$, which is a contradiction because $y''$ should be negative at some part of the interval $(a, b)$ where $y(x) > 0$.\n\n     Similarly, if $y(x) < 0$ on $(a, b)$, then $y'' = (x^3 + kx)y$ would be negative, implying $y'' < 0$, another contradiction since $y''$ should be positive at some part of $(a, b)$. \n\n     Hence, $y(x)$ can have at most one root beyond $x_0$. This implies an upper bound on the number of zeros, given that $y(x)$ cannot oscillate indefinitely beyond $x_0$.\n\n4. **Showing Unbounded Roots Below $x_0$:**\n   - Suppose we can find a certain point $x_2$ such that for any $x < x_2$, $y(x) \\neq 0$. We confront two cases:\n   \n     **Case 1: $y(x) \\geq 0 \\text{ for all } x < x_2$:**\n     - Choose $x_3 < x_2$ so that $x_3 + kx < -2$ for all $x < x_3$, hence $y'' = (x_3 + kx)y < 0$.\n     - For any $a < b < x_3$, we have $y(a) < y(b)( 1 - (b - a)^2)$.\n     - If $y'(b) > 0$, for sufficiently large $(b - a)$, $y(a)$ could become negative, a contradiction since $y(x)$ is assumed non-negative. Hence, $y'(b) \\leq 0$. Then $y(a) \\leq y(b) + 1/2 (b - a)^2 y''(\\xi) \\rightarrow$ which leads to $y(a) < y(b)(1 - (b - a)^2)$, ensuring negativity for enough large $(b - a)$. Another contradiction.\n\n     **Case 2: $y(x) < 0$:**\n     - Similarly, analyse $y'' = (x_3 + kx)y \\leq 0$ for $x < x_3$, leading us to conclude that $y(a) \\geq -y(b)(1 - (b - a)^2)$.

Could it be possible that any sum of a natural number of rubles can be assembled using these coins, such that no denomination is used more than 6 times?", "ground_truth_solution": "1. Let's start by defining the given conditions and the chosen number $\\alpha$. The chosen number $\\alpha > 2$, and all coin denominations are $\\alpha^k$ for each natural $k$, except for the smallest denomination which is 1 ruble. Additionally, $\\alpha$ is selected such that $\\alpha > 2$ and the values of $\\alpha^k$ for $k \\geq 1$ are irrational.\n   \n2. We demonstrate that mathematicians could have chosen $\\alpha = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{29}}{2}$. This number is a root of the equation:\n\n   \\[\n   \\alpha^2 + \\alpha = 7 \\implies \\alpha^2 + \\alpha - 7 = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. To confirm this choice, let's solve the quadratic equation $\\alpha^2 + \\alpha - 7 = 0$. The roots are given by:\n\n   \\[\n   \\alpha = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n   \\]\n   where $a = 1$, $b = 1$, and $c = -7$. Substituting these values,\n\n   \\[\n   \\alpha = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 28}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{29}}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Since $\\alpha > 2$, we select the positive root:\n\n   \\[\n   \\alpha = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{29}}{2}\n   \\]\n\n4. We need to check if $\\alpha > 2$:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{29}}{2} > 2 \\implies \\sqrt{29} > 5 \\implies 29 > 25\n   \\]\n\n   This inequality holds, so $\\alpha = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{29}}{2} > 2$.\n\n5. Next, we need to ensure that $\\alpha^k$ yields irrational values for each natural $k$. For any integer $m$, we have that:\n\n   \\[\n   (2\\alpha)^m = a_m + b_m \\sqrt{29}\n   \\]\n\n   where $a_m$ and $b_m$ are integers. For all natural $m$, we inspect the signs of $a_m$ and $b_m$ according to the parity of $m$. If $m$ is odd, we have $a_m < 0 < b_m$, and if $m$ is even, $a_m > 0 > b_m$.\n\n6. Given these conditions, $\\alpha^m$ is irrational as required by considering that irrational numbers $a + b \\sqrt{29}$ where $b \\neq 0$ are indeed irrational.\n\n7.

Assume that we can form the sum $n$ rubles in multiple ways using the given coins, primarily all choices must cover taking $n$ one-ruble coins.\n\n9.

Begin by finding the smallest integer \\( k \\) such that:\n\n   \\[\n   k^2 \\geq 7301\n   \\]\n\n   Calculate:\n\n   \\[\n   27^2 = 729 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 28^2 = 784\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the smallest \\( k \\) is 28 (since \\( 27^2 = 729 < 7301 \\)).\n\n   - Next, find the largest integer \\( m \\) such that:\n\n   \\[\n   m^2 \\leq 16003\n   \\]\n\n   Calculate:\n\n   \\[\n   40^2 = 1600 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 41^2 = 1681\n   \\]\n\n   Thus, the largest \\( m \\) is 40 (since \\( 41^2 = 1681 > 16003 \\)).\n\n4. **Counting the Perfect Squares**:\n   - The sequence of perfect squares from \\( 28 \\) to \\( 40 \\) includes all integers: \n\n   \\[\n   28, 29, 30, \\ldots, 39, 40\n   \\]\n\n   - The number of integers in this sequence is calculated by:\n\n   \\[\n   40 - 28 + 1 = 13\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the required count of rational numbers is 13.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n\\[\\boxed{13}\\]", "response": "\\boxed{2}"}

{"problem": "A regular octagonal prism has all faces touching an inscribed sphere with a radius of \\(3.3 \\text{ cm}\\).

This distance is known as the apothem of the regular octagon.

We aim to determine whether the probability that the sum of the numbers rolled is not less than 300 is greater than the probability that the sum is less than 120. \n\n2. **Notation and Expected Sum Calculation:**\n   For a single fair six-sided die, the expected value (mean value) of the number rolled is:\n   $$\n   \\mathbb{E}[X] = \\frac{1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6}{6} = \\frac{21}{6} = 3.5\n   $$\n   Hence, the expected sum $S$ of the numbers rolled for 60 dice is:\n   $$\n   \\mathbb{E}[S] = 60 \\times 3.5 = 210\n   $$\n\n3. **Transforming the Dice Results:**\n   If each number rolled on the dice is transformed from \\(x\\) to \\(7 - x\\), the sum of these transformed numbers for 60 dice would be calculated as follows:\n   \\begin{align*}\n   & \\text{Original sum} = S \\\\\n   & \\text{Transformed number} = 7 - x \\\\\n   & \\text{New sum after transformation} = \\sum_{i=1}^{60} (7 - x_i) = 420 - \\sum_{i=1}^{60} x_i = 420 - S\n   \\end{align*}\n   \n   The transformation shows that the new summed value is \\(420 - S\\).\n\n4. **Symmetry Argument:**\n   Due to the symmetry in the distribution of the sum values 60 dice can exhibit, the number of ways to get a sum greater than or equal to 300 should be directly related to the number of ways to get a sum less than or equal to \\(420 - 300 = 120\\). Essentially:\n   \\[\n   P(S \\geq 300) = P(S \\leq 120)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Considering the Probability Greater Than 300:**\n   Since the average value is 210 (well within the possible range), we consider the cumulative probabilities from both ends of the spectrum. The probability that the sum is not less than 300 includes:\n   \\[\n   P(S \\geq 300) = P(S > 300) + P(S = 300)\n   \\]\n   \n   The probability that the sum is not less than 300 integrates all outcomes where the sum of the dice faces is from 300 up to the maximum possible (360), including the precise sum of 300.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   By comparing these adjusted probabilities, especially noting that the probability for \\(S = 300\\) itself would add a non-zero term to the cumulative non-less-than-300 probability, whereas the less-than-120 \\(S \\leq 120\\) term has no analogous mid-value jump.

For a player \\( k \\), the expected value can be calculated by considering the win probability and stake:\n\n   \\[\n   \\mathbb{E}_{\\text{player k}} = (L - L_k) p_k + (1 - p_k) (-L_k) = 0\n   \\]\n   where \\( L \\) is the total pot and \\( L_k \\) is the stake of the \\( k \\)-th player.\n\n6. **Solve for Stakes \\( L_k \\):**\n   - Simplifying the fair game condition:\n     \\[\n     L (p_k) - L_k p_k - L_k + L_k p_k = 0 \\implies L_k = L p_k\n     \\]\n   \n7. **Stakes Proportional to Win Probabilities:**\n   - Since \\( p_k = \\left( \\frac{35}{36} \\right)^{k-1} p_1 \\), the stakes should correspond to:\n     \\[\n     L_{k+1} = L \\left( \\frac{35}{36} \\right)^k p_1\n     \\]\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - Each player's stakes must decrease geometrically with the factor \\( \\frac{35}{36} \\). Thus, for the game to be fair, the stake of each subsequent player needs to be \\( \\frac{36}{35} \\) times smaller than the previous player’s stake.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe stake of each following player must relate to the previous player’s stake as\n \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{35}{36}}\n\\]", "response": "\\boxed{36}"}

Therefore, the areas of triangles $BOK$ and $COK$ are also equal, as they share a common base $OK$ and have the same height from vertices $B$ and $C$ respectively.\n\n3. **Calculation of Areas and Heights**:\n   \n    The area of $\\Delta BOK$ can be expressed as:\n    \\[\n    S_{BOK} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot BK \\cdot BO \\sin \\angle BOK\n    \\]\n    The area of $\\Delta COK$ can be expressed similarly:\n    \\[\n    S_{COK} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot CK \\cdot CO \\sin \\angle COK\n    \\]\n\n4. **Equality of Heights and Bases**:\n   \n    Given $S_{BOK} = S_{COK}$ and knowing that $BK = CK$ (since $K$ is the midpoint of $BC$ being the point where the median intersects), it follows that:\n    \\[\n    BO \\sin \\angle BOK = CO \\sin \\angle COK\n    \\]\n    Since $O$ is the intersection of the median, altitude, and angle bisector, $\\angle BOK = \\angle COK$.

Recall that a tetrahedron is a polyhedron with four triangular faces, six edges, and four vertices.\n\n2. **Properties of a Tetrahedron**: All edges in a regular tetrahedron are of equal length, and every face is an equilateral triangle.

Inserting 8 does not necessarily preserve this property.\n    - Therefore, 8 is not a coordinating number.\n\n10. **Check $B = 9$:**\n    - Similar to 3, a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Inserting 9 increases the sum by 9, preserving divisibility by 9.\n    - Therefore, 9 is a coordinating number.\n\n11. **Check $B = 10$:**\n    - Like 5, a number is divisible by 10 if its last digit is 0. Inserting 10 keeps this property.\n    - Therefore, 10 is a coordinating number.\n\n12. **Check $B = 11$:**\n    - For a number divisible by 11, the difference between the sum of the digits at odd positions and even positions must be divisible by 11.

Each side of \\( BYZ \\) is scaled by \\(\\frac{k}{k+1}\\), giving area scaling of:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area}(BYZ) = \\left( \\frac{k}{k+1} \\right)^2 \\cdot \\text{Area}(BCD)\n   \\]\n   Its height is \\(\\frac{1}{k+1}\\) of the height of \\( A \\) above \\( BCD \\). Thus, the volume of the prism \\( WXPBYZ \\) is:\n   \\[\n   V(WXPBYZ) = \\text{Area}(BYZ) \\cdot \\text{height} = \\left( \\frac{k}{k+1} \\right)^2 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{k+1} \\right) \\cdot V(ABCD)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 3 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{k^2}{(k+1)^3} \\right) \\cdot V(ABCD)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Combine and Simplify Volumes:**\n   The total volume \\( V(ABWXYZ) \\) is the sum of two previously calculated volumes:\n   \\[\n   V(ABWXYZ) = V(APWX) + V(WXPBYZ) \\\\\n   = \\left( \\frac{k^3}{(k+1)^3} \\right) V(ABCD) + 3 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{k^2}{(k+1)^3} \\right) V(ABCD)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{k^3 + 3k^2}{(k+1)^3} \\cdot V(ABCD)\n   \\]\n\n6. **Volume of the Remaining Tetrahedron:**\n   The volume of the remaining part of \\( ABCD \\):\n   \\[\n   V(\\text{other part}) = V(ABCD) - V(ABWXYZ) \\\\\n   = V(ABCD) - \\frac{k^3 + 3k^2}{(k+1)^3} \\cdot V(ABCD)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\left( 1 - \\frac{k^3 + 3k^2}{(k+1)^3} \\right) \\cdot V(ABCD) \\\\\n   = \\frac{(k+1)^3 - (k^3 + 3k^2)}{(k+1)^3} \\cdot V(ABCD)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{k+1 - k^2}{(k+1)^3} \\cdot V(ABCD)\n   \\]\n\n7. **Ratio of Volumes:**\n   Therefore, the ratio of volumes of the two parts is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{V(ABWXYZ)}{V(\\text{other part})} = \\frac{\\frac{k^3 + 3k^2}{(k+1)^3}}{\\frac{(k+1)^3 - (k^3 + 3k^2)}{(k+1)^3}} = \\frac{k^3+3k^2}{(k+1)-k^3-3k^2}\n   \\]\n   After simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{k^2(k+3)}{3k+1}\n   \\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{k^2(k+3)}{3k+1}}\n\\]", "response": "\\boxed{\\frac{k+1}{k}}"}

Suppose \\(y\\) is even:\n   \\[\n   y = 2y_0 \\quad \\text{where} \\quad y_0 \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n   \\]\n   Substitute \\(y\\) into the equation:\n   \\[\n   4x_0^3 + (2y_0)^3 + 2z^3 - 6x_0(2y_0)z = 0 \\implies 4x_0^3 + 8y_0^3 + 2z^3 - 12x_0y_0z = 0\n   \\]\n   Divide the equation by 2:\n   \\[\n   2x_0^3 + 4y_0^3 + z^3 - 6x_0y_0z = 0\n   \\]\n\n6. Continue by analyzing the parity of \\(z\\). Suppose \\(z\\) is even:\n   \\[\n   z = 2z_0 \\quad \\text{where} \\quad z_0 \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n   \\]\n   Substitute \\(z\\) into the equation:\n   \\[\n   2x_0^3 + 4y_0^3 + (2z_0)^3 - 6x_0y_0(2z_0) = 0 \\implies 2x_0^3 + 4y_0^3 + 8z_0^3 - 12x_0y_0z_0 = 0\n   \\]\n   Divide the equation by 2:\n   \\[\n   x_0^3 + 2y_0^3 + 4z_0^3 - 6x_0y_0z_0 = 0\n   \\]\n   We now have an equation similar to the original but with smaller prime factors and gcd still being 1.\n\n7. The transformation \\(x = 2x_0\\), \\(y = 2y_0\\), \\(z = 2z_0\\) means if \\((x, y, z)\\) were a solution, then \\((x_0, y_0, z_0)\\) would be a solution too. Because gcd repeats similarly indefinitely, leading to smaller possible integers.\n\n8. Thus, this repetition and the reduction to the primitive forms ensure that such a non-zero integer solution would require indefinite, non-terminating reduction \\( \\implies \\) contradiction with primitive non-zero integer solution possibility.\n\nConclusion:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{There are no non-zero integer solutions.}}\n\\]", "response": "\\boxed{1}"}

A number is called a \"superclassy number\" if this condition holds for at least two of its digits.\n\nNow let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Establish Equations**:\n    - Assume we have a number \\((a, b, c)\\). For it to be a superclassy number:\n        - We should have the following conditions:\n        \\[\n        2a = b \\cdot c \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 2b = a \\cdot c \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 2c = a \\cdot b\n        \\]\n    - Since it's a superclassy number, two of these conditions must be satisfied. \n\n2. **Solve for a and b**:\n    - Let’s consider \\(2a = b \\cdot c\\) and \\(2b = a \\cdot c\\).

We can observe that regardless of their initial values, \\( x, y, z \\) mod 3 will always fulfill:\n   \\[\n   x \\equiv 1, y \\equiv 0, z \\equiv 2 \\quad (\\text{or any permutations that sum to 1 modulo 3})\n   \\]\n   This is because permutations that sum to 1 modulo 3 can only change through the operations defined.\n\n3. **Operation Analysis**:\n   When we perform the operation (choosing two pieces of different colors and painting them the third color), notice the changes:\n   - Suppose we pick one red and one yellow piece, and paint them blue. This would decrease \\( x \\) by 1, decrease \\( y\\) by 1, and increase \\( z \\) by 2.\n   - Representation: \\( x' = x - 1 \\), \\( y' = y - 1 \\), \\( z' = z + 2 \\).\n\n   These operations preserve \\( x + y + z \\equiv 1 \\) (mod 3).\n\n4. **Concrete Example**:\n   Assume the counts of each color as:\n   \\[\n   x = 3a + m, \\quad y = 3b + n, \\quad z = 3c + p, \\quad m, n, p \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}\n   \\]\n   Since \\( x + y + z \\equiv 1 \\) (mod 3) and the residue only alters within the same family.\n\n5. **Operation Sequence for Uniformity**:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{aligned}\n   (3a + m, 3b + n, 3c + n) & \\rightarrow (3(a+2b)+m+2n, 0, 3(c-b)):\n   & & (\\text{Pairing and converting}) \\\\\n   & \\rightarrow (3(a+2b)+m+2n-1, 2, 3(c-b)-1) \\\\\n   & \\rightarrow (3(a+2b+1)+m+2n, 0, 3(c-b-1)) \\\\\n   & \\rightarrow (3(a+2b+2)+m+2n, 0, 3(c-b-2)) \\\\\n   & \\rightarrow \\cdots \\\\\n   & \\rightarrow (3(a+b+c)+m+2n, 0, 0)\n   \\end{aligned}\n   \\]\n\n   This sequence indicates continuous reduction until only \\( x \\) remains.\n\n6. **Conclusion of Statement 1**:\n   These operations show that eventually, all glass pieces can convert to the same color via the operations defined.\n\n#### Statement 2: Final Color Independence\n   \n1. **Structure Invariance**:\n   The operation \\( x + y + z ≡ 1 \\) (mod 3) means that the colors' transformation invariance holds regardless of the operation sequence.\n\n2. **Final Configuration**:\n   Since:\n   \\[\n   x', y', z' = 0, 0, 2005 \\quad or \\quad 0, 2005, 0 \\quad or \\quad 2005, 0, 0\n   \\]\n   This implies the final color is always the remaining color, and due to initial total, red dominates:\n   \\[\n   2005 \\equiv 1 \\quad (\\text{mod 3})\n   \\]\n\n3. **Final Color**:\n   Hence, regardless of the initial configuration or order of operations, final uniform color would be red.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Red}}\n\\]", "response": "\\boxed{1}"}

{"problem": "A geographical (political) map needs to be colored such that two neighboring countries (or provinces) have different colors. What is the minimum number of colors required?

Additionally, we need to confirm if this number is always sufficient.\n\n2. **Key Concept:**\n   \n   The problem can be related to graph theory, where the map is represented as a graph. Each region is a vertex, and each border between two regions is an edge. The problem of coloring the map corresponds to the problem of vertex coloring in a graph.\n\n3. **Four Color Theorem:**\n\n   The Four Color Theorem states that four colors are sufficient to color any map (or equivalently, any planar graph) such that no two adjacent regions share the same color.\n\n   Explicitly, the theorem can be stated as follows:\n   \n   **Theorem (Four Color Theorem):** Any planar graph can be colored with no more than four different colors, such that no two adjacent vertices (regions) share the same color.\n\n4. **Application:**\n   \n   In our context, the map is a planar graph by definition (since it can be drawn on a plane without edges crossing). According to the Four Color Theorem, we can color each map using at most four colors.\n\n5. **Sufficiency:**\n   \n   The Four Color Theorem also assures us that four colors are always sufficient for this purpose. There has been extensive proof of this theorem, confirming that there are no maps requiring more than four colors.\n   \n6. **Necessity:**\n\n   The necessity of four colors arises from various configurations of regions. While some maps might be colored using fewer than four colors, there exist complex configurations where using fewer than four colors is impossible. For instance, a map requiring three colors due to three mutual borders will have regions configured such that four colors cover all possibilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of colors required to color any geographic or political map such that no two adjacent regions share the same color is indeed four.

The cube has the property that each face must have at least one black edge. We need to find the minimum number of black edges required to achieve this condition.\n\n2. **Basic Properties:**\n   - A cube has 12 edges and 6 faces.\n   - Each face of the cube has 4 edges.\n\n3. **Analyzing Requirement Per Face:**\n   Since each face must have at least one black edge, let us first establish the number of black edges that each face would minimally require when considering the cube as a whole.\n\n4. **Double Counting:**\n   Consider this: if we were to give each face at least one black edge independently without thinking through the scenario that these edges are shared among faces, we would mistakenly assume we need 6 black edges (one for each face). However, since each edge on the cube is shared by two faces, this count is not accurate.\n\n5. **Distributing Black Edges:**\n   Let’s distribute the edges. To minimize the count but still ensure every face has at least one black edge, we can consider an arrangement where each black edge contributes to two different faces. \n\n6. **Minimum Calculation By Edge Sharing:**\n   Any set of 3 edges in a cube such that no two edges share a vertex would suffice:\n   - Let’s pick the middle edges of three non-adjacent pairs of opposite faces. These edges are independent and combine uniquely across opposite pairs of faces.\n   - In this way, every face of the cube will have exactly one black edge.\n\n   - Justification:\n     - Let’s analyze this using clear pairs: \n       - One black edge between face (A-B) and face (A-D).\n       - Another black edge between face (A-B) and face (C-D).\n       - The third black edge lies between face (A-D) and face (B-C).\n     - Visualize splitting the cube into sections or checking corner vertices ensures no repeated sharing midpoint edges, achieving coverage without redundancy.\n\n7. **Verification of Conditions:**\n   After placing these black edges as described:\n   - Each face used will definitely have at least one edge colored black, fulfilling the cube’s requirement that every face must include at least one black edge.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe minimum number of black edges necessary to ensure that each face of the cube has at least one black edge is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]", "response": "\\boxed{5}"}

The angle bisectors will divide each angle into two equal parts.

Without loss of generality, we assume that this domino is horizontal, therefore it covers the cells $a1$ and $b1$ (as it is $2 \\times 1$ domino).\n\n4. **Examining Adjacency Constraints**:\n   Look at the cell next to $a1$, which is $a2$. If the domino covering cell $a2$ were to be placed horizontally, it would form a $2 \\times 2$ square with the domino covering $a1$ and $b1$. Hence, the domino covering $a2$ must be placed vertically to avoid forming a $2 \\times 2$ square.\n\n5. **Eliminating All $2 \\times 2$ Squares**:\n   Next, observe the domino covering cell $b2$. If this domino were placed vertically, it would again form a $2 \\times 2$ square with the domino covering $a2$ and $a3$.

Color the grid such that alternate squares are colored differently, similar to a checkerboard pattern. For simplicity, let the two colors be black and white.\n\n2. **Initial Observation on Movement:**\n\n   When moving the token from one square to an adjacent square (having a common side), the color of the square changes. That is, if it is currently on a black square, it will move to a white square, and vice-versa.\n\n3. **Color of Initial and Final Positions:**\n\n   The starting position (bottom-left corner) and the ending position (top-right corner) must be examined for their colors. Both these positions are corners of the grid, and due to the checkerboard-like coloring, they will both be of the same color.\n\n4. **Analyzing the Path Requirement:**\n\n   To ensure that the token moves through each of the $2018 \\times 2018$ grid's squares exactly once, the total number of moves required will be $$2018^2 - 1 = 4072323 - 1 = 4072323.$$\n\n   This number is odd. \n\n5. **Contradiction in Path Length and Color Parity:**\n\n   Moving from a square to an adjacent square always changes the color of the square.

We can do this systematically by placing pieces at the intersections of even-numbered rows and columns.\n\n4. **Placing Four-Liners:**\n\n   - Rows: Consider even-numbered rows (2, 4, 6, 8, 10).\n   - Columns: Similarly, consider even-numbered columns (2, 4, 6, 8, 10).\n\n   Place a piece on each cell where these even-numbered rows and columns intersect:\n   - $(2,2), (2,4), (2,6), (2,8), (2,10)$\n   - $(4,2), (4,4), (4,6), (4,8), (4,10)$\n   - $(6,2), (6,4), (6,6), (6,8), (6,10)$\n   - $(8,2), (8,4), (8,6), (8,8), (8,10)$\n   - $(10,2), (10,4), (10,6), (10,8), (10,10)$\n\n   This ensures that no two four-liners are on adjacent cells, neither horizontally, vertically, nor diagonally.\n\n5. **Counting the Non-Attacking Four-Liners:**\n\n   Each of the considered positions is unique and non-attacking due to our systematic placement. Since we have considered five even-numbered rows and five even-numbered columns, it results in:\n   - $5 \\text{ rows} \\times 5 \\text{ columns} = 25 \\text{ four-liner pieces}$.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe maximum number of non-attacking four-liner pieces that can be placed on a $10 \\times 10$ board is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{25}\n\\]", "response": "\\boxed{20}"}

We need to determine the maximum number of consecutive natural numbers that can be “semi-prime,” defined as numbers that are larger than 25 and can be expressed as the sum of two different prime numbers. \n   \n2. First, let's identify consecutive sets of five semi-prime numbers, starting with the set from 30 to 34:\n\n   - $30 = 13 + 17$\n   - $31 = 2 + 29$\n   - $32 = 3 + 29$\n   - $33 = 2 + 31$\n   - $34 = 5 + 29$\n   \n   We can see here that each number from 30 to 34 is the sum of two different prime numbers.\n\n3. Let's consider another set, for instance, from 102 to 106:\n\n   - $102 = 5 + 97$\n   - $103 = 2 + 101$\n   - $104 = 31 + 73$\n   - $105 = 2 + 103$\n   - $106 = 47 + 59$\n   \n   Again, each number in this set is a semi-prime.\n\n4. Now, let's consider six consecutive natural numbers. Assume that within any sequence of six consecutive numbers, there are exactly three odd numbers. These odd numbers increment by 2.\n\n5. If an odd number is expressed as the sum of two natural numbers, one of the summands must be even and the other odd. If both numbers are primes, the even number must be 2. Therefore, the odd semi-primes within a span of six numbers would look like:\n   \n   - $2 + \\text{prime}_1$\n   - $2 + \\text{prime}_2$\n   - $2 + \\text{prime}_3$\n   \n   Here, $\\text{prime}_1$, $\\text{prime}_2$, $\\text{prime}_3$ must be consecutive odd primes.\n\n6.

This implies:\n   \n   - One of these numbers is 5, which cannot be a semi-prime as it is less than 25.\n\n7. Thus, this contradiction indicates that it is impossible for a sequence of six consecutive natural numbers to all be semi-primes under the given definition.\n\n8.

Here's a detailed solution:\n\n1. **Strategy Formulation**:\n   - We begin by noting that the 2007 points divide the circle into 2007 arcs. Because each arc is defined by a pair of consecutive marked points, there are 2007 such arcs.\n\n2. **Selection of the Largest Arc**:\n   - Among the 2007 arcs, there is at least one arc that is the largest. Let us denote this largest arc by $AB$, where $A$ and $B$ are the endpoints of the arc on the circle. If there are multiple such largest arcs, pick any one of them for convenience.\n\n3. **Erase a Specific Point**:\n   - The instruction to the assistant is straightforward: erase the point $A$ defining the largest arc $AB$.\n   \n4. **Magician's Observation**:\n   - When the magician enters the room, they will see 2006 points and hence 2006 arcs. However, because one point was erased, one of the arcs is now larger than any of the remaining original arcs.\n   - This newly largest arc was formed by combining two adjacent original arcs when the point $A$ was erased.\n\n5. **Identification of the Semicircle**:\n   - Let's denote the two arcs that were adjacent to $A$ before erasure as $AC$ and $CB$.\n   - After the point $A$ is erased, the arc $CB$ becomes the largest arc. This is because it now includes the segments previously contained in the arcs $AC$ and $CB$.\n   \n6. **Largest Combined Arc**:\n   - Since $AB$ was the largest original arc, the new largest arc, which is now lacking the original $A$, will necessarily include the previous location of point $A$ since a point adjacent to a larger arc makes the arc larger.\n\n   - Thus, if we observe $CB$ to be largest, then $A$ must have been on this arc before it was erased.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The magician can confidently note that since $CB$ is the largest arc now, the erased point $A$ was the endpoint of $CB$. Therefore, the semicircle that includes arc $CB$ (now expanded to include where $A$ was) is the correct semicircle.\n\n8. **Final Answer**:\n   - Following this agreement, the magician can always determine that the erased point lay on the semicircle opposite to the largest arc post-erasure.\n\nHence, the magician and assistant's coordination will ensure the trick always works, as the magician will always identify the correct semicircle. \n\n\\(\\boxed{\\text{Erase the endpoint of the largest arc.}} \\)", "response": "\\boxed{2}"}
