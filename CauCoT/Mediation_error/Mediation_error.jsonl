{"id": 158, "problem": "Consider a cube where all edges are colored either red or black in such a way that each face of the cube has at least one black edge. What is the minimum number of black edges?", "ground_truth_solution": "\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**  \n   We are given a cube where each edge is either colored red or black. The cube has the property that each face must have at least one black edge. We need to find the minimum number of black edges required to achieve this condition.\n\n2. **Basic Properties:**\n   - A cube has 12 edges and 6 faces.\n   - Each face of the cube has 4 edges.\n\n3. **Analyzing Requirement Per Face:**\n   Since each face must have at least one black edge, let us first establish the number of black edges that each face would minimally require when considering the cube as a whole.\n\n4. **Double Counting:**\n   Consider this: if we were to give each face at least one black edge independently without thinking through the scenario that these edges are shared among faces, we would mistakenly assume we need 6 black edges (one for each face). However, since each edge on the cube is shared by two faces, this count is not accurate.\n\n5. **Distributing Black Edges:**\n   Let’s distribute the edges. To minimize the count but still ensure every face has at least one black edge, we can consider an arrangement where each black edge contributes to two different faces. \n\n6. **Minimum Calculation By Edge Sharing:**\n   Any set of 3 edges in a cube such that no two edges share a vertex would suffice:\n   - Let’s pick the middle edges of three non-adjacent pairs of opposite faces.

Color the grid such that alternate squares are colored differently, similar to a checkerboard pattern. For simplicity, let the two colors be black and white.\n", "2. **Initial Observation on Movement:**\n", "   When moving the token from one square to an adjacent square (having a common side), the color of the square changes. That is, if it is currently on a black square, it will move to a white square, and vice-versa.\n", "3. **Color of Initial and Final Positions:**\n", "   The starting position (bottom-left corner) and the ending position (top-right corner) must be examined for their colors. Both these positions are corners of the grid, and due to the checkerboard-like coloring, they will both be of the same color.\n", "4. **Analyzing the Path Requirement:**\n", "To ensure that the token moves through each of the \\(2018 \\times 2018\\) grid's squares exactly once, the total number of moves required will be \\(2018^2 - 1 = 4072324 - 1 = 4072323\\), which is an odd number.", "   This number is odd. \n", "5. **Contradiction in Path Length and Color Parity:**\n", "   Moving from a square to an adjacent square always changes the color of the square. Therefore, after an odd number of moves, the token will end up on a square of the opposite color. Since the starting and ending positions are of the same color, an odd number of moves is required to return to the same color.\n", "6. **Conclusion on the Number of Moves:**\n", "   Since $4072323$ moves are needed, which is an odd number, it is impossible to start on a black square and end on a black square (or start on a white square and end on a white square) because the parity of moves (odd) matches the parity requirement (odd) for the same color for start and end positions.\n", "### Conclusion:\n", "Thus it is possible to move the token from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner, passing through each square exactly once.\n", "$$\\boxed{\\text{Possible}}$$\n"], "Error type": "Mediation error"}

First, let's identify consecutive sets of five semi-prime numbers, starting with the set from 30 to 34:\n\n   - $30 = 13 + 17$\n   - $31 = 2 + 29$\n   - $32 = 3 + 29$\n   - $33 = 2 + 31$\n   - $34 = 5 + 29$\n   \n   We can see here that each number from 30 to 34 is the sum of two different prime numbers.\n\n3. Let's consider another set, for instance, from 102 to 106:\n\n   - $102 = 5 + 97$\n   - $103 = 2 + 101$\n   - $104 = 31 + 73$\n   - $105 = 2 + 103$\n   - $106 = 47 + 59$\n   \n   Again, each number in this set is a semi-prime.\n\n4. Now, let's consider six consecutive natural numbers. Assume that within any sequence of six consecutive numbers, there are exactly three odd numbers. These odd numbers increment by 2.\n\n5. If an odd number is expressed as the sum of two natural numbers, one of the summands must be even and the other odd. If both numbers are primes, the even number must be 2. Therefore, the odd semi-primes within a span of six numbers would look like:\n   \n   - $2 + \\text{prime}_1$\n   - $2 + \\text{prime}_2$\n   - $2 + \\text{prime}_3$\n   \n   Here, $\\text{prime}_1$, $\\text{prime}_2$, $\\text{prime}_3$ must be consecutive odd primes.\n\n6. In any group of three consecutive odd numbers, one is divisible by 3. If such a number that is divisible by 3 is prime, it must be 3 itself. This implies:\n   \n   - One of these numbers is 5, which cannot be a semi-prime as it is less than 25.\n\n7. Thus, this contradiction indicates that it is impossible for a sequence of six consecutive natural numbers to all be semi-primes under the given definition.\n\n8.
