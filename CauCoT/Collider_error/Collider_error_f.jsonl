Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Consider the Pyramid Base:**\n   - The base of the pyramid is an equilateral triangle with side length \\(a\\).\n   - Let the vertices of the base be \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\).\n   - The area of the equilateral triangle base is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area}_\\text{base} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} a^2.\n     \\]\n\n2. **Height of the Pyramid:**\n   - The height \\(h\\) is from the centroid of the base to the apex \\(D\\).\n   - The centroid divides the height in the ratio 1:3, thus:\n     \\[\n     h = \\frac{3}{2} d,\n     \\]\n     where \\(d\\) is the altitude of the equilateral triangle base.\n\n3. **Determine Cube's Placement:**\n   - The cube's vertices are arranged such that they lie on different faces of the tetrahedron.\n   - Given symmetry and constraints, we analyze the side \\(x\\).\n\n4. **Cube Edge Relations:**\n    - We need to relate the cube edge \\(x\\) to the pyramid's side \\(a\\) and height \\(h\\).\n    - The distance from the centroid of the base to a vertex is \\(a\\sqrt{3}/3\\).\n\n5. **Height Relationship:**\n    - Consider the height of the pyramid, \\(h\\), and its relation to the cube's vertices.\n    - Height from the midpoint of an edge of the base to apex:\n      \\[\n      \\text{height} = \\sqrt{h^2 + \\left(\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\right)^2}.\n      \\]\n\n6. **Combining Relationships:**\n   - Surface geometry further adds complexity in 3D space.\n   - Using trigonometric relations in a tetrahedron, we get constraints from different faces of the cube.\n\n7. **Equating Variables:**\n    - After thorough trigonometric analysis,\n      \\[\n      x = \\frac{3 a h}{3 a + h(3 + 2\\sqrt{3})},\n      \\]\n      where all calculations maintain dimensional consistency.\n\nThus, the side length of the cube, \\(x\\), is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{3 a h}{3 a + h(3 + 2\\sqrt{3})}}\n\\]",

This is a key observation since it links $Q^{\\prime}$ and $C$ through the geometry of the circle.\n\n   - Since $P^{\\prime}$ and $Q^{\\prime}$ are the midpoints of $AP$ and $AQ$, $Q^{\\prime}$ lies on the line segment \\(PQ\\).\n\n   - Recall that in a circle, the angle subtended by a diameter is $90^\\circ$. Therefore, the angle formed at $Q^{\\prime}$ by $CQ$ and $PQ$ is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\angle Q^{\\prime} C Q = \\angle Q^{\\prime} P Q = 90^\\circ/2 = 45^\\circ\n     \\]\n   \n3. Notice that triangle $APQ$ is equilateral with each angle $60^\\circ$. Given that $\\angle Q^{\\prime} C Q = 45^\\circ$ and $\\angle Q^{\\prime} P Q = 45^\\circ$, combining these with the properties of the equilateral triangle will mean that:\n   \\[\n   \\angle B C Q^{\\prime} = \\angle B C A + \\angle A C Q^{\\prime} = 60^\\circ + 0^\\circ = 60^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n4. Further, since $B$ and $C$ are vertices of the equilateral triangle, another key property is:\n   \\[\n   \\angle C B Q^{\\prime} = \\angle A B Q^{\\prime} = 60^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n5. Since all interior angles in $\\triangle B Q^{\\prime} C$ are $60^\\circ$, we conclude that:\n   \\[\n   \\triangle B Q^{\\prime} C \\text{ is equilateral}\n   \\]\n   \n6. Similarly, for triangle $C P^{\\prime} D$, the same arguments hold:\n   - $P^{\\prime}$ and $C$ on the semicircle imply:\n     \\[\n     \\angle P^{\\prime} C P = \\angle P^{\\prime} D = 45^\\circ\n     \\]\n   \n   - Also, angle properties similar to those used above yield:\n     \\[\n     \\angle D C P^{\\prime}= 60^\\circ, \\quad \\angle C D P^{\\prime}= 60^\\circ \n     \\]\n\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\triangle C P^{\\prime} D \\text{ is equilateral}\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Both triangles } BQ^{\\prime}C \\text{ and } C P^{\\prime} D \\text{ are equilateral}}\n\\]",

Therefore, the number 999 does not pair with any other number, and it should be excluded from the pairwise analysis.\n",

            "3. **Regions Formed by Non-Horizontal Lines:**\n   - Let \\(a_{0, s}\\) represent the number of regions formed by \\(s\\) non-horizontal lines.\n   - Since each new non-horizontal line intersects all previous \\(s-1\\) lines in distinct points, adding each line increases the number of regions formed.\n   - Specifically, \\(a_{0, s} = a_{0, s-1} + s\\).\n",

            "5. **Adding Horizontal Lines:**\n   - Each horizontal line intersects all \\(s\\) non-horizontal lines, increasing the number of regions by \\(s + 1\\).\n   - If we include \\(h\\) horizontal lines, the total number of regions is:\n     \\[\n     a_{h, s} = a_{h-1, s} + (s + 1)\n     \\]\n   - This can be expanded recursively to:\n     \\[\n     a_{h, s} = a_{0, s} + h(s+1)\n     \\]\n",

            "5. **Check $B = 4$:**\n    - A number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4. Inserting 4 into an arbitrary position may not guarantee this condition is preserved.\n    - Therefore, 4 is not a coordinating number.\n",
            "6. **Check $B = 5$:**\n    - A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. Inserting 5 into the middle of $A$ will make the last digit either 0 or 5.\n    - Therefore, 5 is a coordinating number.\n",
            "7. **Check $B = 6$:**\n    - Since 6 is the product of 2 and 3, both of which are coordinating numbers, 6 will also be a coordinating number.\n    - Therefore, 6 is a coordinating number.\n",
            "8. **Check $B = 7$:**\n    - Divisibility rules for 7 are sophisticated and inserting 7 can disrupt these properties.\n    - Therefore, 7 is not a coordinating number.\n",
            "9. **Check $B = 8$:**\n    - A number is divisible by 8 if the number formed by the last three digits is divisible by 8. Inserting 8 does not necessarily preserve this property.\n    - Therefore, 8 is not a coordinating number.\n",
            "10. **Check $B = 9$:**\n    - Similar to 3, a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Inserting 9 increases the sum by 9, preserving divisibility by 9.\n    - Therefore, 9 is a coordinating number.\n",
            "11. **Check $B = 10$:**\n    - Like 5, a number is divisible by 10 if its last digit is 0. Inserting 10 keeps this property.\n    - Therefore, 10 is a coordinating number.\n",
            "12. **Check $B = 11$:**\n    - For a number divisible by 11, the difference between the sum of the digits at odd positions and even positions must be divisible by 11. This condition is preserved on inserting 11.\n    - Therefore, 11 is a coordinating number.\n",
            "13. **Check $B = 12$:**\n    - Since 12 = 3 × 4, and we already determined 4 is a coordinating number, 12 will also be a coordinating number.\n    - Therefore, 12 is a coordinating number.\n",
            "14. **Check $B = 15$:**\n    - Since 15 = 3 × 5, both of which are coordinating numbers, 15 will also be a coordinating number.\n    - Therefore, 15 is a coordinating number.\n",
            "15. **Check $B = 66$:**\n    - Since 66 = 2 × 3 × 11, and all these factors are coordinating numbers, 66 must be a coordinating number.\n    - Therefore, 66 is a coordinating number.\n",
            "16. **Check $B = 90$:**\n    - Since 90 = 2 × 3 × 5, all these factors are coordinating numbers, so 90 will also be a coordinating number.\n    - Therefore, 90 is a coordinating number.\n",
            "Since 90 is a multiple of 2, 3, and 5, and these are coordinating numbers, we must check if 90 itself maintains the property of divisibility when inserted into any $A$ that is divisible by 90.",

They were each given a card, with a unique number written on it. After looking at the cards of their neighbors, each person at the table said: \"My number is greater than that of each of my two neighbors.\" After this, $k$ of the people said: \"My number is less than that of each of my two neighbors.\" What is the maximum possible value of $k?",
        "ground_truth_solution": "1. Consider that there are 2015 persons sitting around a circular table, each given a card with a unique number written on it. Each person is either a knight, who always tells the truth, or a liar, who always lies.\n2. The problem specifies that each one of them respectively observes the cards of their two neighbors and makes a statement about their own card based on these observations.\n3. Let's first establish some notation:\n   - Let $A$ be the person who received the card with the smallest number.\n   - Let $B$ be the person who received the card with the largest number.\n\n4. According to the statements, everyone says: \"My number is greater than the numbers of my two neighbors.\"\n   - If $A$ (the person with the smallest number) says this, it must be a lie because it’s impossible for the smallest number to be greater than its neighbors. Therefore, $A$ is a liar.\n   - If $B$ (the person with the largest number) says this, it must be true because the largest number is larger than any other number. Hence, $B$ is a knight.\n\n5. Consequently, $A$ and $B$ must have said the first phrase, \"My number is greater than the numbers of my two neighbors,\" because they have the smallest and largest numbers respectively.\n\n6. Now, consider the maximum number of people $k$ who can truthfully say:\n   - \"My number is less than the numbers of my two neighbors.\"\n\n7. Note that $k$ persons saying this statement means they must all be knights because liars cannot truthfully make any statements.\n\n8. Arrange the 2015 people in such a manner that can potentially allow a maximum number of knights to say the second statement:\n   - Place the cards in increasing order around the table. Assume the cards are labeled with numbers \\(1, 2, 3, ..., 2015\\).\n   - If the card with number 1 is held by $A$ (liar), and the card with number 2015 is held by $B$ (knight), then the remaining 2013 people have cards numbered from 2 to 2014, which, according to the problem's conditions, can allow them to truthfully say their numbers are less than those of their two neighbors.\n\n9. Thus, apart from $A$ and $B$, the remaining 2013 people can all claim: \n   - \"My number is less than the numbers of my two neighbors.\"\n   - With $A$ and $B$ excluded (since they cannot say the second statement), the number of individuals who can truthfully say the second statement is 2015-2=2013.\n\n10. This establishes that the maximum possible value for $k$ is 2013.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2013}\n\\]",
